              <c>Sustainability The Board is mindful of its responsibilities regarding climate change and sustainability more broadly, which are central to the Company’s purpose and strategy (for further details on this, see pages 2 and 3, and pages 54 to 77). It has carefully considered how it can deal with matters relating to sustainability in the most efficient and appropriate way, in light of Melrose’s decentralised model and the industries in which its businesses operate. The Board oversees and retains ultimate responsibility for Melrose’s initiatives, disclosure and reporting in respect of improving the sustainability performance of its businesses. The Board receives regular training at least annually, and quarterly updates are provided for the Board, on sustainability and climate issues that impact the Group’s businesses. The Board also receives quarterly updates on key sustainability and climate- related issues that impact the sectors in which the Group’s businesses operate, and on the specific measures that are required to be implemented to drive improved sustainability performance over the longer term, for the benefit of all stakeholders.</c>

              <c>Sustainability In 2019, global movements such as Fridays for Future as well as the United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 have created a lot of momentum for the environmental and socio‑economic challenges that our world is facing. As a result, consumers and customers are increasingly aware of the impact they have on the environment and society. Companies are more than ever expected to act upon issues related to climate, water, packaging, poverty etc. in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. A thoughtful, authentic approach to sustainable business practices will help companies generate greater trust, help to attract employees, increase brand and customer loyalty and, eventually, strengthen competitive advantage.</c>

              <c>PLANNED FUTURE ACTIONS With regulatory changes such as Part L and Part F, we see a movement away from historically inefficient building design. The standards around heating and ventilation are, of course, a response to the wider context of climate change and sustainability. Polypipe is well positioned with a range of solutions across our portfolio, from underfloor heating to air based-solutions using low energy MVHR and heat pump based systems. These drivers also interact with issues of air quality, which we address through our Nuaire and Domus brands, but also through the green solutions of our Permavoid offer.</c>

              <c>In 2019 we further developed the sustainability strategy established in 2018 around four pillars: People &amp; Communities; Energy &amp; Climate Change; Responsible Material Usage; and Responsible Supply Chain. During the year we communicated this strategy internally under the concept of “small changes – big impact”, underlining and encouraging everyone’s role in contributing to the sustainability agenda. We also recognised ESG as a Principal Risk, encompassing the issues of waste management, our carbon footprint, single-use plastics and climate change. To further underscore the importance the Board places in this topic, the Group Sustainability Committee created in 2018 was elevated to a Board committee in 2019.</c>

              <c>Tackling climate change and social inequality have long been at the heart of our sustainability agenda. But more of the same isn’t going to bring emissions down in line with the Paris Agreement, or end poverty. That’s why we’ve set ambitious new targets for improving the health of the planet and contributing to a fairer and more socially inclusive world, with aggressive timelines. And we’re encouraging others – such as our suppliers and industry peers – to take bold steps, since only through working together can we make sustainable living commonplace.</c>

              <c>How do you manage risks relating to climate change? Climate change has the potential to impact our business strategy in a number of ways. For example, physical changes such as rising temperatures and an increase in flood risk could affect our customers and influence where and how we build our homes. We use our Sustainability and Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Register to guide the climate change adaptation of our business practices and the homes we build.

              <c>— The Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee met twice during the year. The Committee assesses the impact of Sainsbury’s corporate responsibility and sustainability strategy on how we help customers live well for less and in terms of building customer trust — In January 2020 we committed to investing £1 billion over 20 years towards becoming Net Zero across our own operations by 2040. This is in line with the highest ambition of the Paris Climate Change Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. We have refreshed our sustainability governance structure with the creation of the Net Zero Steering Group, along with specific working groups, who will be responsible for driving and executing this strategy — We will use the £1 billion investment to support seven commitments focused on reducing carbon emissions, food waste, plastic packaging and water usage and increasing recycling, biodiversity and sustainable diets in order to improve our climate change resilience — As part of our Net Zero by 2040 strategy, we will provide clear, frequent disclosures on our progress. As signatories of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we will use scenario modelling to further assess the impact of current and emerging climate change on our business model and strategy</c>

Our assessment of these activities identified three regions/ countries with significant movement on climate policies over the last few years: Australasia, Europe and South Africa. As such, we focused our 2020 review on our direct and indirect advocacy activities in these jurisdictions, recognising the importance of concerted and pragmatic policy action to help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

In 2018, following Board discussion, Prudential became a supporter of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). This reflects both the growing expectations of our external stakeholders and colleagues, and the ambition among our businesses to develop their capabilities to pursue products and services aligned to the global need to address the impacts of climate change.</c>

              <c>Planet Urgent and sustained action is needed to address the threat to the health of our planet. The impacts of climate change are being felt around the world and long-term business success is dependent on a healthy and sustainable environment. Our Environmental Policy, available on our website at whsmithplc.co.uk/sustainability, sets out our commitments to minimise our business impacts on the planet, including those relating to climate change, waste management and resource use. We regularly review progress against our objectives and targets and aim for continual improvement year on year.</c>

              <c>In 2019, a principal risk related to climate change, specifically the potential of risk to future revenue changes as a result of failure to transition to an inherently lower carbon product portfolio, was developed and added to our Group risk register (see pages 54 to 57). This principal risk was identified through a range of processes, including horizon scanning, the work undertaken on climate scenario development and inputs from subject matter expertise (such as our environmental advisory committee) and other stakeholders. The Chief Executive is recognised as risk owner for the climate-related principal risk, and the Safety, Ethics &amp; Sustainability Committee has delegated oversight. More detail on our treatment of the climate change principal risk is detailed on page 55.</c>

              <c>27</c>
              <c>As described above we have taken action on our underwriting strategy in 2019, but we cannot be complacent as climate change has more far reaching impacts. In 2019, we continued our drive to increase recycling and reduce waste throughout the business. We also continue to look at the environmental impact of our suppliers and actively look to source our office products locally. However, climate change is not a short term problem and investment in long term solutions and policies are required. We are currently recruiting a sustainability officer to join Beazley who will lead our efforts on climate change and sustainability across the group, aligning the work done to date, and constructing our policy going forward.</c>

              <c>Climate change and energy In April 2016, the Board supported a special resolution proposed by a group of shareholders that was then passed by shareholders at the AGM, in support of strategic climate resilience for 2035 and beyond. The resolution was prepared by the ‘Aiming for A’ coalition of institutional investors, and seeks a step change in companies’ disclosure to investors on how they measure and manage climate change risks and opportunities to their businesses. Further information on our response to the resolution is available in the Anglo American Sustainability Report.</c>

              <c>The group is in the process of calculating and formalising precise targets, through approval by the Science Based Targets Initiative, with 2020 to be adopted as the baseline. As part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the process they have adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the group’s financial statements. Management consider that the impact of climate change does not give rise to a material financial statement impact. We have used our knowledge of the group and sustainability experts to evaluate the group’s risk assessment process in respect of climate change. We assessed there was no significant impact to our audit nor our Key Audit Matters. We discussed with management and the Audit Committee that the estimated financial reporting impacts of climate change will need to be frequently reassessed, as well as the ways in which disclosures in respect of climate change should evolve as the group continues to develop its response to the impact of these risks. We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change made in the other information within the Annual Report with both the financial statements and the knowledge we obtained from our audit.</c>

At the heart of Marshalls’ sustainable business model is an approach which combines key business issues and key performance indicators with third party verification, legislation and industry standards including ISO14001 for environmental management and ISO50001 for energy management. We have clear environmental, energy and climate change policies in place and are on track to meet our policy commitments. Key environmental issues for us are climate change, water and biodiversity. Marshalls’ successful management of environmental issues has been recognised by third parties such as Business in the Community. In addition to our mandatory duty to report annually on our greenhouse gas emissions, Marshalls continues to report voluntarily to the Carbon Disclosure Project. We report in detail on our initiatives in the Sustainability Report published on our website.</c>

This has provided insight and key information that has helped educate the Board on the Group’s climate change ambitions and the key factors that need to be considered to enable the Group to achieve its desired outcomes. The ESG deep dives were hosted by senior colleagues from the Corporate Communications and Sustainability team and Leadership Team members where relevant. External support and insight will also continue to be valuable as the Group’s ESG capabilities enhance and mature.</c>

              <c>When COVID-19 emerged in the first quarter of 2020, some observers feared the virus would distract policymakers, business leaders and investors from other sustainability challenges, including climate change. Instead, the opposite has occurred, with positive climate policy developments in the EU, China, the US and elsewhere. Many commentators observed that the apparent ability of the coronavirus to jump from animals to humans was a reflection of unsustainable practices, a warning shot that must be heeded if we are to avert future disasters, be they health related or environmental. At the same time, the optimists observed that the extraordinary mobilisation of resources to combat COVID-19 provides a template for a similar response to climate change. What is beyond doubt is that the pandemic has helped push environmental concerns to</c>

Firstly, it considers the 2019 performance on USLP targets reported on Unilever’s website, alongside performance evidenced in a number of sustainability ratings and indices. These targets illustrate how Unilever aims to address a number of its principal risks, such as brand preference, climate change, plastic packaging, supply chain and ethics (see our risks on pages 46 to 50). The second part of the assessment takes into account Unilever’s wider progress on sustainability.</c>

An immediate example of this was our Board listening session to investigate the impact of climate change and especially water scarcity on our business, value chains and people living in the communities where we work. Members of our CRSEC Committee, joined by our CEO and leading executives, heard from representatives of international NGOs, Indian State Government, the investor community, the UK Government who are hosting the 2021 global climate conference, and a key Reckitt customer, Amazon, which has prioritised climate change in its work. The session provided an excellent review of the issues facing business and communities, and the perspectives of the different stakeholders on climate change and water scarcity. It enabled Reckitt to embrace these perspectives in its work and supported stronger oversight of the agenda amongst the CRSEC Committee members involved. Further sessions are planned during 2021 on a range of ESG issues. More information on our engagement activities can be found on pages 49 to 55.</c>

While climate change and being ‘green’ are really important to them, they are not fully aware of the extensive work that Sainsbury’s does in this area, an insight that has helped inform the communications plan for our new strategy. The Committee was engaged in upcoming regulatory developments on childhood obesity, resources and waste, clean air, employment reform and the cost of these to the business, which fed into the development of the new Net Zero by 2040 plan. Learnings from the 2020 Sustainability Plan and other stakeholders were also considered. After a broad discussion, at a number of Committee and Board meetings between September 2019 and January 2020, the Net Zero by 2040 plan was approved as our seventh strategic priority.</c>

Public response to severe natural disasters, including bushfires in Australia this year, heightened scrutiny of potential links between climate change and physical impacts and spurred calls for more rapid and aggressive action from governments and companies. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent reduction in economic activity decreased emissions, which may lead to opportunities to restart economies with a greater focus on sustainability.</c>

Major plans of action, investment, risk management policies, as well as setting key objectives are also taken up by the ESG committee and presented as needed to the Executive committee, and the Board for decision making. This includes reviewing and approving investment required for energy efficiency and low-carbon investments, as well as climate change adaptation.</c>

Our consideration of climate-related risks Climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy (“climate change”) were considered in our audit where they have the potential to directly or indirectly impact key judgements and estimates within the group financial statements. The Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change, as explained in the Sustainability Report on pages 54 to 77. Climate risks have the potential to materially impact the key judgements and estimates within the financial statements. Our audit considered those risks that could be material to the key judgement and estimates in the assessment of the carrying value of non-current assets and impact on future cashflows.</c>

              <c>As an output of the Group risk management process, emerging risks related to climate change were identified at both the 2018 year-end and 2019 mid- year Group Risk Committee and Board risk sessions. At the end of 2018, climate change was not considered to be a principal risk. Due to the rapidly changing external environment, it was agreed to examine this area in more detail in 2019. This was taken forward to a climate change risk workshop facilitated by Group Risk including representatives from sustainability, environment, HSSE, supply chain, commercial, insurance, investor relations, treasury, strategy, security, real estate, travel, and legal. The year-end Group Risk Committee and Board risk session considered the output of the climate change risk workshop, and the resulting new principal risk was defined as failure to meet our ESG responsibilities, as included in the risk table.</c>

              <c>We launched ‘Resourceful, Responsible’, our 10-year Sustainability Strategy, in March 2020. The strategy, which is aligned to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, is centred around three key pillars: building a circular economy; tackling climate change; and caring for our people and supporting our communities. It includes a commitment to unlock £1.25bn of investment in green economy infrastructure, whilst reducing our CO2 emissions by a further 50% in the coming decade. When combined with what we’ve achieved in the last 15 years, that will amount to a reduction in our CO2 emissions by over 80%.</c>

As the global climate crisis becomes more critical, we recognise the importance of addressing long-term sustainability challenges and potential impacts of climate change on our business in reputational, operational and financial terms. Failure to implement appropriate cross-functional action plans and strategies, incorporating the recommendations of the TCFD and Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), could hinder efforts to mitigate long-term risks and future-proof our business.</c>

During 2016 we carried out a materiality assessment to review our current priorities, to help us better understand stakeholder views on key topics and to identify emerging risks and opportunities. This has shown us that we are largely focused on the right issues but there are also opportunities to do more in key areas and to continue to play an active part in addressing major challenges like access to housing and climate change. We will be using the findings to review and strengthen our approach to sustainability in the year ahead. More information can be found within our Sustainability Report 2016.</c>

              <c>Weir has committed to bold targets like reducing its carbon emissions in line with climate science. All these climate change and sustainability commitments are incorporated in the Company’s strategy. Climate change targets including emission reduction and resource efficiencies are part of the management performance scorecard to drive and align behaviours. I was pleased with Weir’s commitment and leadership at the COP26 in Glasgow. It was indeed a showcase of how important Climate Change and Sustainability are in Weir. Integrating these topics into our future strategy is a business imperative and we are already seeing benefits through higher employee retention and customer partnerships.</c>

              <c>One of the things the pandemic did was really shine a light on the positive impact we can make on the climate crisis as individuals, communities, industries and nations. Very quickly after the initial lockdown, photos were posted around the world of the improvement a lack of travel was having on the natural world. I think the demonstration of such marked recovery from all across the globe kept climate change very much on the agenda in 2020 and provided much- needed impetus for action. Within the insurance industry climate change has never been so topical or in the spotlight, and across the market discussions and debates are had in every boardroom and meeting space about the impact, society’s response, and immediate plans to contribute to a better world. Beazley’s ability to move forward at pace will be shaped by the appointment of our Sustainability Officer, Chris Illman. Chris is working across the business to ensure a sharp focus on the challenges of climate change including threats – in terms of determining increased losses and the impact on our business, and opportunities for the development of new products and services that protect against the potential impact of climate change. Naturally we are also interested in our own direct impact as a company on the world around us, which is why we as a management team are committed to harnessing the positive effects of the last year to drive real, sustained change for the future, including a commitment to maintaining significantly lower levels of travel going forward. We also support Lloyd’s recently published ESG strategy, and we look forward to working with them to deliver their sustainability targets.</c>

              <c>PLANT FORWARD MENUS Consuming a plant forward diet, where plant based products are the principal ingredients, is a key pillar in taking action on climate change. We are working towards this by: expanding access to and availability of healthy and plant based menu items, engaging, educating and exciting consumers to make positive choices; and eliciting behavioural change through choice design techniques and communications campaigns. As we continue to work within our businesses, and through industry forums such as the WBCSD food reform for sustainability and health (FReSH) workstream, each year we increase our plant forward food offerings in response to consumer demand and the evidence linking plant based food systems to climate change mitigation. Our strategy in this area is guided globally, but implemented locally, according to consumer preferences and value chain approaches. In 2021, examples included:</c>

              <c>• Asset risk: This is the risk that climate change has a significant impact across a number of industries which may negatively impact the value of investments in those companies. The group considers the impact of climate change on its asset portfolio by seeking to incorporate an assessment of environmental risks in the investment process. We subscribe to the research services of a specialist company in the field of environmental, social and governance research and have integrated their proprietary ratings into the internal credit process applied to investments in corporate debt securities. A minimum standard for the environmental, social and governance performance is defined and companies not meeting the required standard will be excluded from the approved list of issuers. The analysis also includes a consideration of the sustainability of each company with regard to the potential decline in demand in specific sectors.</c>

              <c>Sustainability Focus In 2019 the climate change debate became more regular headline news. Consumers shifted from being ‘aware’ to being ‘concerned’ as large scale fires and floods, along with protests and political and social campaigns, garnered significant media attention amplifying an already growing trend of sustainability awareness. As consumers also become more aware of the impact meat production and consumption has on the environment, plant based trends continue to grow, with veganism becoming more mainstream. This plays well to Original Source’s positioning of ‘better for you, better for the planet’. See page 27 for more details.</c>

              <c>Governance Mitigating climate change is a key priority for our senior leadership, with sustainable finance metrics included in the Group’s strategic priorities. In 2018, there were two presentations on sustainability to the HSBC Holdings Board, two to the Group Audit Committee, four to the Group Risk Committee, and two to the HSBC Group Management Board. Senior leadership have engaged with regulators, industry associations and non-governmental organisations on this topic, such as through the Bank of England consultation on climate change, the Group Chairman’s participation in the One Planet Summit and the Group Chief Executive’s designation as a World Economic Forum climate leader. A summarised list of HSBC’s sustainability-related memberships is available at: www.hsbc.com/our- approach/measuring-our-impact/ sustainability-memberships.</c>

As public concern grows, more customers are asking about GHG emissions within the manufacturing process. The increasing demand for low- carbon products and processes, and the need to consider the effects of climate change in general, have had an impact on our long-term strategy. In March 2021, we announced a commitment to reduce absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 50% (against 2015 levels) by 2030.</c>

              <c>Capacity building, collaboration and industry and regulatory engagement We continue to seek opportunities to build capacity and enhance capabilities within our responsible investment practices. In August 2020, Eastspring participated in a sustainability benchmarking process and capacity-building exercise with the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), one of the world’s largest independent environmental organisations. WWF works with industry associations, regulators, stock exchanges and investors in Asia to support ESG risk analysis and opportunity identification. The benchmarking process is being used as an enabler to further embed sustainability into the business and is aligned with the Group’s strategic focus areas. As part of an ongoing focus on continuous improvement to meet our sustainability ambitions, Eastspring has incorporated actions from the benchmarking exercise into four sustainability work streams focused around purpose, governance, climate strategy and responsible investment. Eastspring also participated in the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) Climate Change Training Project Advisory Committee, the region’s first accredited climate change training.</c>

While this is an area of risk, it is also an area of significant opportunity for Tyman and work is underway to define the Group’s role in this space.

              <c>The risks associated with climate change are coming under an increasing focus, both in the UK and internationally, from governments, regulators and large sections of society. These risks include: physical risks, arising from climate and weather-related events of increasing severity and/or frequency; transition risks resulting from the process of adjustment towards a lower carbon economy (including stranded, redundant or prohibited assets); and liability risks arising from the Group or clients experiencing litigation or reputational damage as a result of sustainability issues.</c>

              <c>Strategy Identifying risks and opportunities Considerations regarding climate change are integrated within our Enterprise Risk Management system. In the current risk reassessment cycle, climate change was elevated from emerging to principal risk status following feedback from our internal stakeholders. Climate change in turn has multiple implications, necessitating further refinement in the identification of the risks and opportunities. The Sustainability team reviews industry association guides, government and international scientific reports, global energy scenarios and the climate change reports of our peers to identify transition and physical risks of climate change. In addition, the Sustainability team engages internal stakeholders from our operations on energy matters, and also engages with government representatives, environmental and legal teams, industry bodies and our peers to gain a better understanding of emerging regulations and developments in technology. The risks and opportunities are reviewed annually by the Head of Sustainability.</c>

              <c>— Transition to net zero, taking action on climate change and sustainability, as part of Our Vision 2030, as a key priority at the heart of both our business strategy and the way we design and create new places. Within its strategy, the Board has included and committed to long-term science-based targets for climate change. This aims to ensure that the Group continues to drive positive actions that address climate change to ensure that Berkeley plays its part in mitigating the global impact by supporting the international effort and Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The Group’s integrated climate action programme puts Berkeley on course to achieve its strategic goal of being a net zero carbon business by 2040.</c>

              <c>Our risk profile has not fundamentally changed this year but we have now more clearly highlighted that Climate Change is one of our principal risk factors. For a number of years we have recognised that changes in climate pose a risk to our business and hence as a part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan we are trying to both reduce our impact on climate change and to prepare ourselves for the impact climate change will have on our business in the coming years, and this risk and our management approach were outlined within our Sustainability risk factor. However following discussions at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, 21st Conference and the Financial Services Board Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, it is clear that the impacts of climate change itself and the potential actions government may take are of such significance that Climate Risk should be separately identified.</c>

              <c>We have a long track record of focusing on sustainability matters and have a comprehensive strategy to address climate change risks. Our physical risk review provides asset-level management information. This informs local planning and helps mitigate potential financial impacts, for example from the introduction of clean air zones. However, new policies often provide opportunities; for example our investment in electric vehicle charging and the potential to utilise our city centre locations to facilitate clean last mile deliveries.</c>

We also launched the equity impact fund, Better Health Solutions Fund, which will invest in both better healthcare and better well-being, such as improved lifestyle, hygiene and safety.

              <c>The Audit and Risk Committee’s twice-yearly review of risk management and internal controls has continued; in February 2021 we were able to remove ‘Brexit’ from our principal risk register, reflecting the successful management by the business of the transition, and the fact that any ongoing impact is not material. As part of the Group’s increasing focus on climate change and sustainability, management has worked with Carbon Trust to carry out an assessment of the risks and opportunities presented by climate change. The output of this review informed the Board’s strategy discussions in May, and have been fed into the principal risk register.

While electric vehicles have a key role to play, it is important we are thinking even bigger, with a need to embed sustainability principles and practices within not just our product strategy but also our business strategy. I am therefore incredibly proud that 2021 has seen Aston Martin join the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), making a long term commitment to a net-zero future for the business. This is one central objective of our new Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy, which has been developed with the passionate support and input of many employees across the business.</c>

              <c>— Climate Change and Natural Hazards. We have specifically identified climate change within this principal risk as it has the potential to impact our efforts to grow a safer, cleaner, healthier future for everyone, every day. At the same time, transitioning to a low carbon economy creates multiple opportunities for us within niche markets with long-term growth drivers. Therefore we are also considering climate change as part of our other risks around growth such as organic growth, acquisitions and innovation. For more information, including the work we are performing to achieve alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), please see the Climate Change section of the Sustainability Report on pages 64 to 77.</c>

              <c>There has been improvement in product sustainability, with 30% of Net Revenue from more sustainable products in 2020. While not quite achieving our 33% goal, this is a strong increase on 2019 during a year when our agenda was dominated by maintaining supply of established products to combat the pandemic. There is significantly more work to do to reduce our product carbon and water footprints in the coming decade. The 2020 target was missed due to a focus on manufacturing footprint until the past two years. We have now increased our focus on product footprints with further evolution of our Sustainable Innovation Calculator (SIC) which is now present in all new product development cycles to enable an ambition that, in some way, all new products are more sustainable than their predecessors. This will support our climate change agenda where we have recently partnered with the Judge Business School at Cambridge University to further assess, understand, and mitigate the impacts of climate change within our global value chains. This partnership will further strengthen our response and support for climate change risk reporting mechanisms.</c>

              <c>Through our audit planning procedures we have made enquiries of management to understand the process they have adopted to assess the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the group’s financial statements. Management’s assessment is in the context of the new principal risk this year in relation to Sustainability, together with the additional disclosures included this year in the Annual Report on the impact of climate change on the future prospects of the business. Management considers that the impact of climate change does not give rise to a material financial statement impact. In response, we have used our understanding of the group to evaluate management’s assessment; in particular we have considered how climate change risks would impact the assumptions made in the forecasts prepared by management used in their impairment analyses, as referenced in the key audit matter in relation to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets above.</c>

              <c>As consumer behaviours and expectations evolve, the Group may fail to adapt its product portfolio and marketing strategy in response to stakeholders’ increasing environmental expectations. Factors such as emerging climate-change, product sustainability and circularity related aspects of the products may result in the potential rejection of the Group’s products as well as reputational risk in relation to business performance and sustainability in comparison to peers. Impact Any disruption to the Group’s supply chain (including agricultural supply chain) and distribution channels could have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial conditions of the Group through failures to meet shipment demand, contract disputes, increased costs, reduced production capacity and loss of market share.</c>

              <c>Climate change risks are assessed by the Executive Sustainability Committee, the Risk Committee and the Board. The Risk Committee meets twice a year and is chaired by our CFO. It reviews key strategic and emerging risks, both operational and �nancial, including sustainability-related issues. We regard climate change to be a principal risk. However, as the longer-term implications of climate change are less well-known, it is also considered an emerging risk.</c>

              <c>Researching consumers’ attitudes to climate change Beyond our climate change risk assessment, we consider consumers’ attitudes through the work of our Brand Sustainability Council. Our research to date has identified a significant increase in consumers’ concerns about the climate crisis. Concerns are translating into action, with a rise in consumers reducing, reusing and recycling packaging across all food and beverage categories, as well as considering the impact of their choices in terms of energy and water used, transport and waste. Consumers are motivated by what matters most to them through personal experience, such as pollution and packaging. Beyond their own actions, consumers expect businesses and governments to act to make the systemic changes needed for the world to combat climate change. We are committed to continually improving the sustainability of our brands and communicating their sustainability credentials in clear, compelling ways.</c>

              <c>Physical and Transitional Climate Change Globally, climate change effects are already emerging in the form of changing weather patterns. Extreme weather events could potentially impair the operations of individual investee companies, potential investee companies, their supply chains and their customers. Legislative changes are driving an economic adjustment towards a low-carbon economy.  There are considerable risks to the value, business model and operations of investee and potential investee companies due to stranded assets and how investors, financial regulators and policymakers respond to climate concerns. The Manager takes such risks into account, along with the downside risk to any company – whether in the form of its business prospects, market valuation or sustainability of dividends – that is perceived to be making a detrimental contribution to climate change. The Company invests in a broad portfolio of businesses with operations spread geographically, which should limit the impact of location- specific weather events.</c>

              <c>Addressing the challenge of climate change is core to our strategy and is therefore at the centre of many Board considerations and decision making throughout the year. This requires robust governance to empower business areas in the management of climate-related risks and opportunities. Our Sustainability Governance Framework ensures that the Board is effective in both making decisions and maintaining oversight, whilst also adhering to our well-established culture of Doing the Right Thing (read more on page 59). Strong governance of sustainability issues, including climate change specifically, extends below the Board to a number of management committees and our TCFD working group, as shown in the infographic.</c>

              <c>I am pleased to report on our progress over the last year. In addition to reviewing matters at our CRSEC Committee meetings, I have held regular meetings with our CEO, Chief Safety, Quality, Regulatory and Compliance (SQRC) Officer, Head of Corporate Affairs &amp; Chief Sustainability Officer, and the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, to review progress against the strategy and to represent the Board in supporting the efforts in these critical areas. Owing to the ongoing restrictions due to COVID-19, since February, all meetings have been held virtually, including all Committee meetings. As a result, no physical site visits took place in the year. However, in December, the Sustainability team held a listening session for the Committee, CEO and senior executives to hear directly from external stakeholders and to update them on the impact of climate change and especially water scarcity on our business, value chains and people living in the communities where we work. The session provided an excellent review of the issues facing business and communities, and the perspectives of the different stakeholders on climate change and water scarcity.</c>

For packaging to be truly sustainable, it must be produced and designed in a sustainable fashion and be biodegradable within a relatively short time. Paper-based packaging is uniquely positioned to do this.</c>

              <c>Longer-term risks are by their nature harder to define. However, we see specific areas of risk and opportunity impacting the Group over a longer timescale. Beyond 2025 it is likely that both the frequency and severity of climate change-related events will continue to grow and require additional planning for our operational teams, for instance in applying appropriate due diligence to new office leases. We also see opportunity within the changing nature of our markets, as governments and business respond to climate change and have begun work to integrate sustainability recruitment into existing business streams.</c>

These discussions considered a range of stakeholders, including investors, communities, governments, employees, customers and suppliers. These stakeholder views were taken into account in considering our updated climate change strategy. In particular, during FY2020 the Board and Sustainability Committee focused on the detailed development of the commitments set out in July 2019: publicly setting a medium-term target for operational emissions, the Climate Investment Program, Scope 3 emissions goals, the link between emissions performance and executive remuneration, and the work to release our new BHP Climate Change Report 2020.</c>

This includes working with the Supply Chain Sustainability School (SCSS), an industry collaboration aimed at improving standards across the construction sector. Over 80% of our national Framework suppliers have now joined the SCSS and completed a sustainability self-assessment. This identifies their strengths and weaknesses in relation to issues such as human rights, resource use and sustainable sourcing and provides an action plan with resources and training materials to help address any gaps. Our suppliers have used these resources over 3,000 times so far, helping to strengthen their approach in areas such as waste, water, community and climate change.</c>

              <c>What we are going to do in 2020 The Board has decided that Coats will take a participative (rather than merely signatory) approach to working with the proxy bodies that represent the environment. This will entail participating in working groups and looking to share best practice with other companies and learn from what has worked for other companies. The key areas for this work in the coming year will be around climate change and controls on effluent. More details on the activities sanctioned by the Board can be found in the Sustainability Report and online.</c>

              <c>In September 2021, the Board received an update on the Group’s corporate sustainability strategy which focuses on sustainable investment activities, particularly in light of climate change. The Board regularly reviews the external commitments to environmental and social causes to measure progress against these. The Board approved an increased budget for charitable giving. When making this decision, the Board considered the impact of partnerships with charities that supported our broader aims around climate change and reducing inequalities, how those funds would be allocated and the impact measured.</c>

              <c>Existing SC members have operational experience in ESG and climate change, and the most recent Board appointments have experience of managing climate change in other organisations. This has strengthened the Board’s expertise in ESG and managing its approach to climate change which has been supported by a third party. In addition, SC invites input from third parties, on a regular basis, to improve its understanding of ESG matters – recent speakers have come from leading industrial companies, global management consultancies and City institutions. The Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) has responsibility for reviewing and approving the content of the climate-related risk disclosures. Details of the ARC and its activities are provided on page 107. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy, including how climate related risks and opportunities are taken into account in determining rewards and incentives. The Remuneration Committee incorporated sustainability and climate-related targets into its remuneration strategy for executive and GMC pay. Details of this can be found in the Remuneration Committee Report from page 113. The Nominations Committee is responsible for Board appointments and succession planning and takes account of experience in sustainability and climate- related risks in fulfilling its responsibilities. Details of the Nominations Committee and its activities are provided on page 101.</c>

              <c>The Melrose senior management team oversees the Group sustainability function. This responsibility includes the publication of the sustainability report and the setting of climate-related targets in line with the TCFD recommendations across the businesses in 2021. We integrate the management of sustainability and climate- related issues across our existing governance and committee structures. Please see page 57 for a diagram that outlines how climate is integrated into our governance and committee structures. We run a decentralised model and overseeing climate-related issues and implementing relevant actions and initiatives is most effective at the individual business level, where most impact can be had. Each business’s CEO and executive management team are accountable for climate change and sustainability. Throughout the year, the Melrose Group sustainability function has engaged with the CEOs and other relevant senior leaders of each business to set expectations and to ensure there is appropriate oversight of the impacts of climate and other material sustainability risks and opportunities. Please see the Divisional reviews on pages 12 to 29 for detail of how the divisions are engaging on climate change.</c>

At the same time, the global mining industry is increasingly prioritising sustainability and production – as evidenced by strong demand for integrated solutions and OE orders for sustainable technology.</c>

              <c>Result of engagement The Board believes that climate change is one of the most important issues facing companies and society in general for the future and this is an area where all stakeholders have an increasing interest. There is increasing regulation and legislation in this area and one where we can provide services to help our customers. In September 2019, the Intertek Total Sustainability Assurance initiative was launched. This is a pioneering initiative that provides an end-to-end independent, systemic sustainability programme from both an operational and corporate perspective.</c>

              <c>CLIMATE CHANGE In preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements management has considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the disclosures included in the Strategic Report this year and the new sustainability goals including the stated net-zero targets. These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the assessment that climate change is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s going concern assessment to June 2023 nor the viability of the Group over the next five years. The following specific points were considered:</c>

              <c>Whilst the Group Board maintains ultimate oversight, the GRC retains primary oversight responsibility for climate change risk, as it has delegated authority from the Group Board for overseeing risk management activities. It advises the Group Board on Admiral’s Principal Risks and Uncertainties (PR&amp;U), as well as on Emerging Risks, and reviews the Group’s management of these risks. Climate change risks are reported quarterly within the Consolidated Risk Report (CRR). Furthermore, internal initiatives in place to reduce the environmental impact of the Group’s operations and to support the transition to a low-carbon economy are monitored by a newly implemented Sustainability Working Group, which encompasses relevant individuals from the Risk, Finance, Facilities and Investor Relations departments. Regulatory developments and emerging best practice are also considered in this forum. The Group CEO periodically attends the working group.</c>

              <c>Climate change The board is conscious of the impact of climate change on our business and how the group’s activities affect the environment. These topics have been discussed by the board and a number of its committees. We were pleased to receive shareholder support at the 2020 annual general meeting (AGM) to continue the group’s commitment to carbon neutrality with respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions of our direct operations, and to report annually on the progress made on our climate related exposures. We will be proposing a further resolution at 2021 AGM, in respect of our Scope 3 emissions. . Further information about the group’s commitment to supporting the transition to a clean and energy-efficient economy can be found in Investec group’s 2021 sustainability and ESG supplementary report.</c>

Since we incorporated climate change into our ESG due diligence questionnaire, several GPs have learned what the climate change risks actually are! For example, LYFE Capital, one of the Asian managers in the PIP portfolio, expressed appreciation for our climate change training at their office recently and have since included climate change risk assessment in their due diligence process. Assisting our GPs on their ESG journey is a part of how we add value as an investor.</c>

              <c>What were the other principal areas of Board focus during the year? Our Board has discussed issues of sustainability, in particular concerning the understanding and management of climate change risks. Our business has always had a strong and purposeful focus on its insurance liability exposures to weather-related events, such as windstorms, floods and wildfires, which are sensitive to climate change trends. The Board and management team have taken steps to broaden the formal oversight, strategic understanding, risk management and forward-looking scenario testing of climate change risk and opportunity. We have taken further steps on the journey to implement the recommendations of the TCFD, in particular in starting to utilise tools for the understanding of climate change risk on the Group’s investment portfolio. We have also debated societal changes, including the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, and we reaffirm the Group’s commitment to building a business which will continue to encourage and reap the benefits of an open, honest and diverse culture. For the second year running we will be reporting by reference to the United Nations Principles for Sustainable Development.</c>

For management employees – up to and including the ULE – reward packages include fixed pay, a bonus as a percentage of fixed pay and eligibility to participate in a long-term management co-investment plan (MCIP) linked to financial and sustainability performance. The Sustainability Progress Index accounts for 25% of the total MCIP award. It includes amongst others consideration of progress against our manufacturing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas target and a deforestation goal covering palm oil. Subject to shareholder approval at the 2021 AGM the MCIP will be replaced by a Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the performance measures for the PSP will continue to include the Sustainability Progress Index.

              <c>change as a potentially disruptive and systemic global risk in the medium to long-term, but it is to recognise climate change as a factor which can influence certain risks to, and opportunities for, our business, which we do have the expertise to assess and manage. Other factors which influence our principal underwriting risk include seismic or volcanic activity, political unrest and instability, secular changes in technology and oil price fluctuations, to name a few. We have the great benefit of employing experienced underwriters who are experts in risk appraisal and whose decisions are informed by powerful models and actuarial tools, which factor in thousands of assumptions including some that may be influenced by climate change projections. Climate change risk can also influence asset values within our investment portfolio or present reputational risk to our business in its management. Our conservative investment strategy factors in the exposure of the Group’s investment portfolio to a whole range of risk scenarios which might impair the value of assets, and our management and Board remain committed to the prudent day-to-day management of the whole universe of risks which both challenge and present opportunities to our business. Lancashire has also for many years chosen to offset its own greenhouse gas emissions. Please see pages 43 and 44 of our engagement and sustainability report for further details.</c>

As such, during the year the Committee took significant interest in the sustainability agenda and the metrics and reporting that underpin it. The Committee supported the CCRC and Audit Committee on the oversight of progress as reporting in this area continued to evolve throughout 2021.</c>

              <c>4. New growth sectors and new opportunities: Many companies perform significantly better in scenarios with stronger climate action, including  low carbon utilities and cleantech manufacturers. As part of its climate ambition, NatWest Group continues to support customers through £20 billion climate and sustainable funding and financing and by reserving at least 25% of the spaces in our Entrepreneur Accelerator hubs for businesses where their core offering supports sustainable environmental activities (including climate solutions). In addition, Commercial Banking has introduced a framework to encourage activity that supports the sustainability and climate change agenda. As part of the capital allocation process, corporate customers that are aligned with sustainability and climate change benefit from a lower allocation of capital allowing more competitive pricing. This benefit can also be applied at an individual facility level where a customer seeks funding for a specific, Climate Positive activity (e.g. land transport business looking to fund a fleet of EVs). This will help to reshape NatWest Group’s portfolio as it moves towards more sustainable transactions and sectors.</c>

              <c>The Board monitors the Group’s business activities and external and internal environments for new, emerging and changing risks to ensure that these are managed appropriately. Annually, input from each business area is combined with external insight to scan the horizon for emerging risks. A summary of emerging risks is presented for assessment to the Audit Committee and the Board. Emerging risks continue to be monitored as part of the ongoing risk management processes. Climate change is the emerging risk that is currently being considered. Climate change is rapidly becoming a material issue, which may impact both Bunzl’s direct operations and the value chain in which the Group operates. The Group is already facing increased pressure from some customers who expect Bunzl to contribute to their climate change commitments. In future, the Group may face increased business continuity risks from acute and chronic climatic events. To meet increasing demands for greater disclosure of and response to climate-related risks, an analysis has been undertaken to understand how Bunzl businesses may be impacted under different climate change scenarios. This work was carried out as part of revising the Group-level sustainability strategy. For more details on our climate change work see www.bunzl.com/sustainability and pages 48-49 of the sustainability section of this report.</c>

              <c>Researching consumers’ attitudes to climate change Beyond our climate change risk assessment, we consider consumers’ attitudes through the work of our Brand Sustainability Council. Our research to date has identified a significant increase in consumers’ concerns about the climate crisis. Concerns are translating into action, with a rise in consumers reducing, reusing and recycling packaging across all food and beverage categories, as well as considering the impact of their choices in terms of energy and water used, transport and waste. Consumers are motivated by what matters most to them through personal experience, such as pollution and packaging. Beyond their own actions, consumers expect businesses and governments to act to make the systemic changes needed for the world to combat climate change. We are committed to continually improving the sustainability of our brands and communicating their sustainability credentials in clear, compelling ways.</c>

              <c>Climate change risks are assessed in terms of the impact on our business model (climate resilience) and our impact on the environment. Risks are identified from the bottom-up and emerging risk assessments across the business and then reviewed in a specific climate change risk workshop to assess completeness. Climate resilience risks identified form an integral part of a number of our corporate risks and have been referenced in the existing principal risks we are disclosing, where appropriate. Risks around our impact on the environment are considered in the ‘Environment and sustainability’ principal risk.

              <c>Despite the challenges of COVID, we did not stand still on our carbon related targets, and in fact, took the opportunity to stretch and reinforce them. In 2018, Whitbread set a science- based target to reduce carbon emissions intensity by 50% by 2025 and 84% by 2040. We have already achieved a reduction of nearly 40% and so we are well on our way to achieving the first target. However, this year, we wanted to go further and have now updated our carbon target to aim for net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, which is a full decade earlier than the original plan. We know this is a huge task, but it is one that is vitally important for our business and the battle against global climate change. Our carbon strategy was externally recognised this year as we improved our Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Climate Change score to A-, putting us in the Leadership category, granted only to those seen to be implementing best practices on sustainability.</c>

              <c>— In planning our audit, we made enquiries with management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the financial statements. Management concluded that there was no material impact on the financial statements. Our evaluation of this conclusion included challenging key judgements and estimates in areas where we considered that there was greatest potential for climate change impact. We particularly considered how climate change risks would impact the assumptions made in the valuation of investment properties as explained in our key audit matter below. We also considered the consistency of the disclosures in relation to climate change made within the Annual Report, the financial statements and the knowledge obtained from our audit. We assessed the consideration of the cost of delivering the Group’s climate change and sustainability strategy within the going concern and viability forecasts.</c>

              <c>Climate change risk As explained more fully in ‘Our sustainability focus areas’ climate change presents an ever increasing focus for both the Government and wider society. For our business, the risk from climate change presents itself in a number of principal areas. Transitional risks and opportunities are those relating to actions the business takes to meet the challenge of operating in a net zero carbon economy. These include the risks to construction from the use of new technology and materials aimed at reducing carbon emissions. These risk areas are embedded within the Group’s risk management process in a number of areas, including Construction, Availability of raw materials, sub-contractors and suppliers and Government planning and regulation. Physical risks and opportunities relate to changing climate, which can impact on the comfortable heating of homes and the ability of developments to withstand extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall.</c>

              <c>The Board increased its oversight of environmental, social and governance factors in 2021, with climate change, and diversity and inclusion being areas of increasing focus. Not only did the Board receive multiple updates on progress to increase disclosures on ESG matters, but the Audit and Risk Committees also increased their respective oversight of the implementation of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and relevant Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) disclosures. The Remuneration Committee also considered proposals during the year to link ESG metrics to reward. Further information on TCFD and climate change can be found on page 107, and further information on Admiral’s SASB disclosures can be found in our Sustainability Report (published separately on our website).</c>

              <c>Sustainability and our ESG policies The Board’s approach Environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues can present both opportunities and threats to long-term investment performance. The Company’s investment universe comprises sectors that are likely to be highly impacted by increasing regulation as a result of climate change and other social and governance factors. Your Board is committed to ensuring that we have appointed a Manager that applies the highest standards of ESG practice. The Board believes that BlackRock is well placed as Manager to fulfil these requirements due to the integration of ESG into its investment processes, the emphasis it places on sustainability in its investment stewardship activities and its position in the industry as the largest supplier of sustainable investment products in the global market. More information on BlackRock’s approach to sustainability is set out below.</c>

Our leadership team owns our sustainability ‘journey’ and they have engaged the global sustainability consultancy Environmental Resources Management (ERM Ltd) to undertake a robust review of JM’s internal processes and external reporting against the TCFD framework to help us align it with best practices by the end of 2021. The review includes a detailed assessment of JM’s approach to identifying and managing both risks and opportunities related to the low carbon transition and physical climate change. ERM will also evaluate JM’s climate scenarios and how they are used to assess the potential implications for our business strategy. Adapting to climate change is an ongoing journey. We will continue to integrate it into our strategy, systems and processes and will be ready to be fully compliant with upcoming UK regulation on TCFD reporting for our annual report 2022.</c>

Our 2020 Sustainability Fact Book includes a full list of the TCFD recommendations alongside references to our disclosure against them. We see ongoing development of good practice on climate-related disclosures in our sector and beyond, in part as a result of an iterative process of feedback from stakeholders.

The Group’s use of the term “sustainability” comprises Health &amp; Safety management (i.e. embedding a culture of safety and ensuring safe working environments), conducting business with integrity, protecting the environment, preparing for and managing the impact of climate change on business activities, managing stakeholders, attaining strong social performance credentials and, lastly, using the foregoing to generate innovation and other business opportunities to create value. Against this backdrop, the nature of the Group’s activities pose or create certain inherent risks, responsibility for which is vested with operating entity management, Group and Divisional management and the Board of Directors.</c>

From ocean plastics and climate change to biodiversity loss, every business in every industry can and must play a role in finding solutions to global environmental issues. Innovative new applications for fibre-based packaging can help to address the plastics issue. Transport emissions, now the UK’s biggest carbon emitter, can be reduced in e-commerce supply chains using smart packaging solutions. Optimised quality recycling of corrugated packaging reduces the need for virgin fibre inputs.</c>

The Board receives regular training, at least annually, on sustainability issues that impact our businesses, including climate change. The Board also receives quarterly updates on key sustainability and climate-related issues that impact the sectors in which the Group’s businesses operate, and on the specific measures that need to be implemented to drive improved climate-related performance of the businesses. Please see the governance overview on page 57 for details of how sustainability and climate-related issues fit into wider Melrose governance and Board responsibilities.

              <c>In 2019 we further developed the sustainability strategy established in 2018 around four pillars: People &amp; Communities; Energy &amp; Climate Change; Responsible Material Usage; and Responsible Supply Chain. During the year we communicated this strategy internally under the concept of “small changes – big impact”, underlining and encouraging everyone’s role in contributing to the sustainability agenda. We also recognised ESG as a Principal Risk, encompassing the issues of waste management, our carbon footprint, single-use plastics and climate change. To further underscore the importance the Board places in this topic, the Group Sustainability Committee created in 2018 was elevated to a Board committee in 2019.</c>

              <c>As part of our audit, we made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change on the financial statements, including reviewing management’s climate change risk assessment which was prepared with support from The Carbon Trust. We used our knowledge of the Group and we engaged with our sustainability specialists to evaluate the risk assessment performed by management. We assessed that the key financial statement line items and estimates which are more likely to be materially impacted by climate change are those areas that are based on future cash flows. As a result, we particularly considered how climate change risks and the impact of climate commitments made by the Group would impact the assumptions made in the forecasts prepared by management that are used in the Company’s impairment analysis and for going concern purposes. Our procedures did not identify any material impact on our key audit matters for the year ended 31 December 2021. We also reviewed the disclosures included in the TCFD section of the Annual Report and we considered the consistency of these disclosures with the relevant financial statement disclosures, including in note 1c, and with our understanding of the business.</c>

              <c>Society Sustainability, including climate change, is becoming an ever more pressing challenge facing society. Many would argue that the pursuit of sustainable goals can be constrained by a lack of accompanying social progress, including efforts to address social and economic inequality. Business has an important role to play in addressing each of these challenges – but the private sector cannot address the unprecedented challenge of climate change alone. It needs to work within strong and predictable policy frameworks and alongside robust local and global institutions promoting inclusive and sustainable growth.</c>

              <c>Through the USLP, we are also responding directly to a number of macro forces (see page 8) that are both risks and opportunities in our markets – such as a lack of access to water and sanitation, strains on the food system, climate, the environment, and rising inequality. We have identified the broad issue of sustainability, related to the achievement of our goals in the USLP, as a principal risk (page 29) as well as a number of specific risks including climate change (page 30) and plastic packaging (page 30). Mitigating the physical impacts of climate change is critical because we depend on raw materials sourced from countries that are particularly vulnerable to rising sea temperatures and changing weather patterns. See pages 33 to 35 for our response to the risks and opportunities from a low-carbon economy.</c>

Similarly-rated risk events are considered together, and categorised into three key Group-wide registers. This summary position is discussed and approved by the Group Management Team (GMT), and this ensures the correct identification of the Principal Risks and Uncertainties (see pages 44 to 51). Our Sustainability and Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Register highlights the material risks and opportunities facing the Company in relation to sustainability and climate change.

Government, businesses and communities are working to reduce social inequality and mitigate or adapt to climate change. There is also growing scrutiny of the ways companies treat their partners and supply chain. How businesses respond to these issues will determine their resilience and competitiveness over the long term. Smart, progressive thinking can help support the relationships and resources companies rely on to prosper and grow, and in the transition to a low-carbon economy.</c>

              <c>2018 has seen a step-change in the significance of sustainability for the business community and for society more widely. The awareness that began with the Paris Climate Accord in December 2015 has gained momentum with major media events such as Blue Planet 2, increasingly frequent extreme weather events, public concerns over plastics and food waste and the most recent predictions of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. There is a clear and growing expectation from investors and other stakeholders that businesses understand our exposure to climate risk in particular, and have a relevant, meaningful response. Positive Places, the sustainability programme we began over ten years ago, was designed to deliver on exactly this agenda. It continues to demonstrate leadership, delivered successful outcomes for all our stakeholders in 2018 and will do the same in 2019.</c>

              <c>— Sustainability: With the increasing awareness of the risks of climate change and of inequalities in society, consumers are looking to buy more sustainable products that have been responsibly sourced. Approximately 40%2 of our total Group sales now come from products that create greener, healthier homes (versus a target we set 10 years ago of 50% by 2020/21). This includes LED lighting, low-flow taps, and low VOC paint. In 2021/22, we will be reviewing our approach with a view to updating this target.</c>

Our current sustainability initiatives, including our CO2(e) emissions reduction targets, and related financial analysis and planning are based on a base case scenario reflecting the current commitment from the COP21 Paris Agreement to limit global temperature increases over the next century to 2°C. In coming years, we expect to expand our analysis to include a downside scenario reflecting the risk of a 4°C global temperature rise trajectory and associated acceleration in global climate change mitigations.</c>

In May, we hosted a seminar on our second largest business, Retail Banking, in London. Increasingly, investors are engaging us on ESG matters including the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals, climate change, coal and human rights. Following our commitment at the AGM, we hosted several bilateral engagements covering our Sustainability Philosophy, updated Position Statements and our Prohibited Activities list. These and other topics were covered at the Chairman’s stewardship and strategy forum in September.</c>

              <c>Greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of these emissions on climate change pose one of the major global challenges for the tourism sector. The goals we set ourselves in our sustainability strategy “Better Holidays, Better World”, launched in September 2015, include operating Europe’s most carbon-efficient airlines by 2020 and defending this top position. Specific carbon emissions (g CO2 / PKM) are to be reduced by 10 % by 2020. We also aim to reduce the carbon intensity of our global operations by 10 % by 2020 (against the baseline of 2013 / 14).</c>

              <c>OUR APPROACH We are actively seeking ways to reduce our impact on the environment and build resilience to climate change by focusing on energy, waste and understanding the impact of global climate change on our operations. These three focus areas were updated in 2021 based on a materiality review of our environmental impacts and risks, with a focus on impacts that we can influence. These focus areas are periodically reviewed by our Environmental Committee, consistent with broader sustainability goals and reporting guidelines.</c>

              <c>BlackRock’s approach to sustainable investing Sustainability is BlackRock’s standard for investing, based on the investment conviction that integrating sustainability can help investors build more resilient portfolios and achieve better long term, risk-adjusted returns. BlackRock believes that climate change is now a defining factor in companies’ long-term prospects and that it will have a significant and lasting impact on economic growth and prosperity. BlackRock believes that climate risk now equates to investment risk and this will drive a profound reassessment of risk and asset values as investors seek to react to the impact of climate policy changes. This in turn is likely to drive a significant reallocation of capital away from traditional carbon intensive industries over the next decade.</c>

              <c>In previous years all businesses had separately considered the effects of climate change within the context of other risks. With increasing interest in this area amongst our staff, as well as other stakeholder Groups, all businesses commenced a more coherent approach this year to implement actions which improve HomeServe’s environmental impact. With discussions also occurring at Board and Exec level, the potential impacts of climate change and other environmental considerations on HomeServe’s business model have been considered more formally and Sustainability is now reported separately as a Group Enterprise Risk.</c>

The Remuneration Committee consulted with shareholders on remuneration during 2021 and again in January 2022.</c>

Our Company Secretary will continue to provide an update on sustainability matters, including climate change, at each Board meeting. Our Board and Audit and Risk Committee will continue to formally review our principal risks twice a year – bolstered by our newly-formed Risk and Resilience Committee, which will carry out a ‘deep dive’ into climate change at least annually.

              <c>Board responsibility for climate-related risks and opportunities: Our Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the Group’s climate-related objectives and strategy. Climate change is regularly discussed at Board and Board Committee meetings. Climate change is a principal risk, and the Board has assessed the Company’s risk appetite for climate change as medium, as set out in our Principal risks section on page 23. An important part of our governance is to incorporate climate considerations into the way we allocate capital and we have recently updated our capital allocation framework to include climate resilience as part of our decision making processes. Climate change factors are considered by all our Board Committees in their deliberations and three in particular support the Board in monitoring and evaluating climate-related risks and opportunities. • The Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Committee considers climate change</c>

              <c>With 2021 came COP26, bringing with it a further spotlight on the critical state of our planet and the need for everyone to play their part in driving change globally. Sustainability and climate change increasingly play a role in investment decisions. Consumers, partners and future talent also have high expectations of organisations to take action rather than just setting targets. Hammerson’s sector-leading approach on sustainability, key to its overall strategy, has continued to deliver reductions in carbon, water, waste and socio-economic impacts.</c>

              <c>Emerging risks Identification of emerging risks is a responsibility of both the Risk and Assurance team as well as each function within easyJet, leveraging risk and subject matter experts across the Group. If an emerging risk is identified by the Risk and Assurance team it is raised with the relevant function. An example of this in practice is the risks arising from climate change. The Risk and Assurance team worked in partnership with our Sustainability team to identify, analyse, quantify and evaluate the climate change risks that easyJet is facing. This was supported with further analysis from Judge Business School at Cambridge University. Further detail is found below.</c>

              <c>Climate change Climate change is an increasingly signifi cant issue for society. The UK Government has an objective of achieving net zero carbon by 2050. As the owner of a portfolio of buildings in central London, we recognise the need to respond to this challenge, with Building Regulations and MEES having an important role. Our strategy to maintain and refurbish existing buildings is an intrinsically sustainable approach. It conserves embodied energy within existing materials and avoids unnecessary waste, materials and energy required to construct new properties. We acknowledge that there is much more to do to meet the challenges of climate change. With over 800 commercial tenancies, we are in a good position to infl uence and support our tenants’ own sustainability strategies. We report on our own impact, but are aware that our tenants’ activities can have a much greater contribution on our environment. We have engaged more widely this year through both the Blue Turtle initiative and the use of a new tenant portal in Seven Dials. Both initiatives will be expanded and used to help guide our tenants’ sustainability activities. We will seek to increase engagement with our tenants, to ensure that we are all working together to address these issues in 2020 and beyond.</c>

              <c>Climate change In our consideration of emerging risks, climate change was identified as an area requiring greater analysis. This is already a component of the failure to evolve our offering risk with regards to the products and services our customers consume and how they might be affected by the drive towards carbon neutrality. In the year ahead, further consideration will take into account the potential impact of our business and supply chain on the global climate, as well as the potential risks and impact of climate change upon our business activities. Our analysis will support more comprehensive future reporting in line with the five pillars approach of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’).

              <c>CLIMATE REPORT 2020: PATHWAY TO NET ZERO In late 2020, we published our third report on climate change, Climate Report 2020: Pathway to net zero. This report focuses on how we will deliver our targeted 40% reduction in total emissions by 2035 on 2019 levels and our ambition, with a supportive policy environment1, to be a net-zero total emissions company by 2050. These reductions will be underpinned by the managed reduction of our coal portfolio. Led by the Climate Change working group – see page 92 – we formulated our climate change strategy in partnership with key stakeholders. Our ongoing engagement activities are core to our commitment to inform stakeholders on our progress, and demonstrating our portfolio resilience under a range of scenarios.

              <c>Prior to the pandemic, climate change and environmental concerns were an area of focus for investors but it is now clear that the pandemic has heightened awareness of sustainability issues and this can be seen in the way businesses operate and governments set policy. This has moved the focus to investing capital in cleaner and greener businesses. We are seeing increasing interest from infrastructure investors in the energy transition sector as the scale of the investment required becomes apparent, and regulations, subsidies, market demand and project economics become more supportive.</c>

              <c>Market dynamics Notwithstanding the impacts from Covid-19, the drivers we describe on the next page will have a significant impact on our markets. Digital technology is disrupting traditional property models and enabling better products, solutions and services. Demographics are changing – there is a growing, ageing population and a larger proportion of millennials and generation Z in the workforce. Changing living, working, shopping and leisure habits will change how property companies operate, with occupiers increasingly demanding a different mix of services. And sustainability is becoming critical to our customers, from social purpose through to resource scarcity and climate change.</c>

              <c>In January 2020, the Group secured the agreement of all lenders in its RCF to the exercise of its first extension option under the terms of the facility, extending the maturity date by one year to 28 January 2025. In December 2020, the Group also secured the agreement of all lenders to the exercise of its second extension option under the terms of the facility, extending the maturity date to 28 January 2026. In November 2020, the Group raised approximately €660 million gross equity proceeds which were allocated to repaying variable rate debt under our RCF and securitisation programmes. In December 2020, the Group aligned its sustainability ambitions and targets into its financing by embedding its sustainability targets via KPIs into its RCF, creating a Sustainability Linked RCF. The Sustainability Linked RCF incorporates five KPIs spanning the Group’s sustainability objectives regarding climate change, forests, water, waste and people, with the level of KPI achievement linked to the pricing on the facility.</c>

              <c>All of the companies in our portfolio recognise the importance of considering climate change and of evolving a sustainable business model. As discussed in the Sustainability report, the physical and transition climate- related risks are also seen as opportunities for all companies in our portfolio. Further work was undertaken at portfolio company level to assess climate-related risk during the year, and we expect this to continue to evolve and become more sophisticated over time.</c>

              <c>STRATEGY Climate change is a major threat to global social and economic development. With operations in 112 countries globally, WPP and our clients are exposed to many of its physical and transition impacts. These include risks relating to climate change regulation and the impact of more frequent extreme weather events on our offices and people in some locations. The most material opportunity for WPP is the potential to work with clients on sustainability-related briefs. Around 13% of our revenues come from clients who have engaged with us on sustainability and as more sectors are impacted by climate change this will increase. WPP’s climate-related risks and opportunities are disclosed in our Sustainability Report and CDP disclosure.</c>

The Risk and Audit Committee and Sustainability Committee assist the Board with the oversight of climate-related risk management, although the Board retains overall accountability for BHP’s risk profile.

              <c>Sustainability is a matter of high importance for our Board and management. We regularly review our non-financial policies and take a collaborative and strategic approach in responding to global trends in ESG areas including climate change, resource scarcity, biodiversity impacts, demographic changes and technological advancements. Risks related to sustainability are recognised in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, described on pages 26 and 27, and details of sustainability risks are included on pages 108 and 109. Our non-financial due diligence processes are well established and we made no material changes to these in 2020.</c>

              <c>There has been an increase in regulatory focus on the issue of sustainable finance, particularly the impacts that climate change risks could have on the safety and soundness of firms and stability of the financial system. The PRA Supervisory Statement SS3/19 set out regulatory expectations about the management of the financial risks linked to climate change. The related PRA Policy Statement PS11/19 requires firms to set out plans for identifying and managing financial risks from climate change. Climate change could affect Just Group’s financial risks in two key ways: (i) as investors increasingly consider sustainability in their investment choices this may restrict investment choice and compress yields in the existing investment universe; it may also create new opportunities to invest in assets that are perceived to be more sustainable; and (ii) increased physical risks such as flooding due to severe rainfall or tidal surges, wildfires, extreme windstorms or heatwaves leading to increased subsidence may affect the value of properties not seen as having such an exposure at present. This could affect our ability to recover the full balances of lifetime mortgages in light of the no-negative equity guarantee.</c>

The assessment identifies topics that are material to our development, performance and current position as well as for our future prospects. It also establishes the material topics for our sustainability strategic review and publications. We identified the following material topics for the 2019–20 period: catastrophic hazards, safety and health, climate change and energy (see page 16), water, land stewardship, responsible sourcing and supply, human rights, social performance and our people (see page 27).</c>

              <c>A number of financial risks could arise from both the physical and transitional risks due to climate change. Management, assisted by an independent expert, has evaluated these as disclosed in the Sustainability section of the Strategic Report. This, with further analysis has then informed the evaluation of financial risks that have been reflected by management in the preparation of the financial statements, or where appropriate allowed it to conclude there is no material impact. The future financial impacts are clearly uncertain given the timeframe involved and their dependency on how Governments, global markets, corporations and society respond to the issue of climate change. Accordingly, financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known.</c>

This amount was further supplemented by the Board of Directors waiving 20% of their base salaries or fees for an initial period of three months.</c>

              <c>Climate Change There are multiple impacts of climate change on companies. Liontrust may be impacted directly, via our outsource partners or through our investments in companies on our clients behalf. The impacts may come from physical risks (extreme weather events, or supply shortages) or from exposure to transition risks which arise from society’s response to climate change (technological change, social upheaval or regulation). These can change business costs, alter the viability of products or services, or alter asset values. There are also legal costs and potential liabilities for climate-related actions. Further information on our efforts to manage this risk and integrate sustainability throughout our business is in the section “Our People, Sustainability and Our Corporate Responsibilities on page 37.</c>

We seek to put sustainability at the heart of everything we do and this section sets out our approach to implementing the recommendations of the TCFD, including how we think about the governance, strategy, risk management and the metrics and targets which underpin our approach. As a company that relies on people, communities and the environment, sustainability is central to our strategy. Our strategy focuses on the positive impact we can have on the communities we serve and on the environment that we rely on. In supporting the creation of value – be that economic, environmental or social – we deliver sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Our Sustainability Framework on page 50 is fully embedded into our overall strategy and draws together our environmental, social and governance ambitions. These are delivered as part of our Business Plan and are fully embedded in the way we work. Additional information can be found in our Sustainability Report.</c>

These included environmental topics ahead of Responsible Investment Day and Shell’s announcement of its target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. Directors received information on opportunities and priorities in the New Energies area. Throughout the year, Directors were also informed about topics of interest among investors and other stakeholder groups. These included sustainability, governance and the energy transition. During the annual strategy meeting, in virtual format, the Board discussed various topics including the energy transition and its implications.</c>

              <c>Climate change risks are integrated into our corporate risk management framework, including through two central risk registers – the Land and Commercial and the Technical Risk Registers which feed into a Group Material Risk Register – and our Climate Change and Sustainability Risk and Opportunity Register. Our Climate Change Register guides the climate change adaptation of our business practices and the homes we build. For each climate-related risk and opportunity the register identifies: risk driver, description of risk, potential impact, timeframe, whether the risk or opportunity is direct or indirect, likelihood and magnitude of impact. This is a standing item on every LEAF committee agenda. The committee makes recommendations to the GMT on how to mitigate, transfer, accept, or control climate-related risks.</c>

              <c>The Board and the Committee are aware of the increased focus from investors on climate change risk, and our approach to sustainability has been discussed at a number of Board meetings during the year. At our Strategy Day in May, we hosted a representative from Carbon Trust, to provide insight on the implications of climate change for our business. As described in the Sustainability Review, the Carbon Trust will be helping us to set climate change targets and carry out a climate change risk assessment in the 2020/21 financial year. The Board and the Committee will subsequently agree on specific responsibilities, including progress and measurement. We have also committed to report against the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures by 2022.</c>

              <c>At a policy level, we continue to lean on our climate change statement in our Stewardship Policy, which sets out our commitment to integration, measurement and engagement. Oversight of how we deliver against this policy and the climate change statement rests with the Sustainability Committee and is reported up to the Ninety One Board. On a day-to-day basis, the investment teams continue to be responsible for understanding and integrating climate risk into their fundamental analysis. They are supported by data and portfolio tools developed by, and managed through, the Investment Risk Team. Ninety One does not operate an exclusion policy with respect to any carbon element at present. The investment teams are expected to account for the risks they are exposed to and then consider engagement with companies to reduce risk and ideally enhance value over time. We are strong supporters of the need to actively finance a global energy transition and, as an emerging market investor, we believe developing regions and companies need capital to be able to transition.</c>

              <c>SUSTAINABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE The Board has spent a significant amount of its time this year discussing climate change and sustainability, reflecting our increased focus and ambition in this area. We have announced ambitious long-term carbon emissions reduction targets that are Paris-aligned, and are supporters of the British Retail Consortium’s Climate Action Roadmap which aims to make the industry net zero by 2040. A major, ongoing, workstream is our preparation to meet the guidelines set by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by FY22. This work has led to a step-change in how we organise ourselves to understand, manage and mitigate risks associated with climate change – and to realise the considerable opportunities from doing this at a strategic level. The Board is committed to ensuring that Dunelm makes its own contribution to addressing the world’s climate change and biodiversity challenge as specifically referenced in both our purpose and shared values.</c>

              <c>During 2019, while we observed a general stability across the majority of our principal risks, changes in risk dynamics required changes in our principal risk articulation. Due to the continued rise in focus on the elements within our sustainability risk area (carbon and climate, packaging and water) we have decided to split that risk into three separate principal risks. This enables us to specifically articulate key elements of the changing consumer sentiment and public debate for each sustainability risk, thereby ensuring specific visibility of the risk elements and related mitigations. In respect of climate change, a broader discussion on our climate-related risks, their link to materiality, and our risk management approach is provided as part of our statement on implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures located on pages 62-63.</c>

              <c>Many of our technologies enable others to achieve their own sustainability commitments including through the protection of natural resources or reduction of carbon emissions. We have recognised this by explicitly including climate change as a new key long-term growth driver for our products and services, and when assessing opportunities for future organic and inorganic growth. The beneficial effects of our products and services, which help solve many critical safety, environmental and health issues, also contribute to the achievement of our chosen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</c>

              <c>We have for several years rigorously measured our GHG emissions using internationally recognised standards, have set GHG reduction targets, have consistently achieved these targets and have taken a science-based goal going forward aligned with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to reduce total life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050. Climate change risk is a component of our business resilience and crisis management programme and we have taken several measures to reduce vulnerability to climate change-exacerbated incidents, such as the improvement of flood defences at Hull (UK). Our new sustainability strategy takes full account of the risks and opportunities presented by climate change, focusing investment on de-carbonising our operations and those of our suppliers and customers. The sustainability strategy is owned by the Sustainability Council, including members of the Executive Committee which ensures that the strategy adequately addresses climate impacts. We understand how important it is to balance environmental initiatives with business activities, and strive to reduce emissions through new technology development, renewable energy use and other measures.</c>

              <c>The responsibility for managing our corporate risk lies with the Executive Committee, Board and Risk Committee. Each year the Executive Committee collate and assess the key risks, which include sustainability/climate change related risks. This assessment seeks to understand risk severity and likelihood as well as the optimal controls and/or mitigation actions required. This approach allows the effects of any mitigating procedures to be considered properly, recognising that risk cannot be eliminated in every circumstance. The risk register is then put forward to the Board and Risk Committee for consideration, review and ultimately adoption. Climate-related risks and opportunities are also highlighted and discussed by the Responsible Business and Sustainability Committees where appropriate. These risks can include transition risk (e.g. regulatory risk and reputational risk) and physical environmental risk.</c>

              <c>SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE The Sustainability Committee was established in December 2021 to ensure that the Directors provide a clear focus and support to the Company’s ESG strategy and targets, and understand the actions required for the Company to achieve its targets and develop relevant and reliable reporting metrics, in line with the growing body of standards in this area. The role of the Committee is to oversee, on behalf of the Board, the Company’s ESG strategy, which focuses on five strategic pillars: creating a better environment; tackling climate change; investing in people and opportunity; exporting success; and delivering the highest standards. The Committee will also oversee broader stakeholder engagement on behalf of the Board. The Committee will meet at least twice a year.</c>

              <c>Another key area of focus for the Committee is oversight of matters relating to sustainability and climate change. Sustainability is at the heart of many issues that are central to Pearson’s future and is a strong area of interest for our core customers as well as many of our investors. We considered the three main pillars for our Sustainable Business Plan 2030 and, building on our conversations in 2019, we discussed the detailed goals, milestones and timeline underpinning the plan. We monitored developments to strengthen our commitments to a sustainable supply chain, hearing about the implementation of a new sustainable supplier risk management model. Additionally, following discussions with sustainability colleagues on Pearson’s approach to climate change reporting, we recommended that Pearson become a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD); thereafter, the company publicly declared its commitment to the TCFD and its recommendations.

              <c>In this regard, we recently announced further steps in the continued optimisation of our portfolio, including the intended divestment of some of our coal assets whose value will be best realised outside BHP, and our non-operated interest in the Bass Strait joint venture. We will create and secure more options in future-facing commodities through innovation, exploration, early stage entry and well-timed acquisitions of attractive resources and assets. We have also announced new roles on the Executive Leadership Team. These changes will help ensure operational and technical excellence are front and centre for the company and that we are successful in creating and securing more options in future facing commodities, which will benefit successive generations of shareholders. Sustainability and resilience BHP’s commitment to sustainability is important and enduring. We have refreshed our approach to sustainability reporting. Key information and performance data is included in this Report and we have significantly expanded our sustainability content on our website, including the provision of a databook to make core information more accessible. The BHP Climate Change Report 2020 details our approach to climate change and the role we will play in addressing it. We have committed to reducing our operational greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by at least 30 per cent from FY2020 levels (1)</c>

              <c>Risks and opportunities arise from growing pressure on the aviation sector for regulatory change, increased greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and potential changes in consumer behaviour. Aviation is perceived as a major contributor to climate change and can sometimes be a discretionary purchase. While in the short term consumers and businesses may decide to switch to alternative modes of travel or fly less frequently/less far due to ethical and sustainability concerns, in the longer term this may be mitigated by the trend towards green aviation. Certain governments and investors may implement policy incentives tying funding to decarbonisation strategies.</c>

              <c>Climate change and sustainability Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events. These extreme weather events have resulted in an increase in political focus, regulation and focus on the economic and social impact of climate change. At the same time, customers have become more attentive to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of their saving and investment decisions.</c>

              <c>– Climate change and sustainability: increasing attention on climate change, including activities by non-governmental and political organisations as well as greater interest by the broader public, reinforce the need to implement our climate change strategy which is described on page 42. We continue to strengthen our management of CR-related risk (including adopting elements of the climate risk framework established by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”)), to improve our transparency, develop our employee and community engagement, and improve the sustainability performance of our products. Failure to follow global business principles of operating professionally, fairly and with integrity, or the public perception that there has been such a failure or other real or perceived failures of governance, or legal or regulatory compliance, could undermine trust in the Group. Our CR strategy acknowledges the key elements of the sustainable development agenda and has been developed to recognise how these factors interact with the Group. Further information about how we run our business in a responsible way is set out on pages 36 to 46, and in our CR report, which is available on our website at www.convatecgroup.com/ corporate-responsibility.</c>

              <c>Identification and management of sustainability risks is incorporated in our strategic risk assessment processes. Our Group Sustainability Committee (GSC), a sub-committee of the Group Executive, monitors short, medium and long-term sustainability risks, their potential impact on our business, and our mitigation measures. The GSC meets at least twice a year and risks are reviewed at each meeting. It is sponsored by our Chief Customer Officer. Our most significant risks are included in our sustainability risk register (part of our overall Group risk management process). At an asset level, we manage climate- related risks through our insurance programmes and by incorporating climate change factors into our planning and design of new stores, refurbishment projects and preventative maintenance programmes.</c>

              <c>At Board level, we have brought the voice of our various stakeholders to life in assessing challenges we face in our value chain. We began a new series of Board listening sessions with a panel on climate change and water stress. Members of our CRSEC Committee heard from one of our key customers, an international NGO partner, the UK Government on the global climate change conference in 2021, an Indian state Government where water stress is a critical issue, and the investor community. The session provided detailed understanding from each stakeholder’s perspective and has helped to frame our ambition on water in our new sustainability agenda. A similar event included members of our Executive who heard from our human rights partner, the Danish Institute for Human Rights, about their human rights impact assessment of our Thai value chain. The subsequent action plan aims to strengthen human rights for people we work with in Thailand.</c>

              <c>Description: The Group is subject to stringent and evolving laws, regulations, standards and best practices from a sustainability perspective. The Group’s use of the term "sustainability" comprises Health &amp; Safety management (i.e. embedding a culture of safety and ensuring safe working environments), conducting business with integrity, protecting the environment, preparing for and managing the impact of climate change on business activities, managing stakeholders, attaining strong social performance credentials and, lastly, using the foregoing to generate innovation and other business opportunities to create value. Against this backdrop, the nature of the Group's activities pose or create certain inherent risks, responsibility for which is vested with operating entity management, Group and Divisional management and the Board of Directors.</c>

              <c>Governance The Board has overall responsibility for the management of risks and opportunities arising as a result of climate change. Climate change has been identified as a principal risk for the Group. The Group has developed a climate change risk register. This was formally reviewed by the Risk Committee in December 2019 and will be regularly reviewed in line with all of the Group’s existing risk registers (see page 61). In addition, the Corporate Responsibility Committee, which was chaired by Marion Sears, a Non-Executive Director, during 2019, monitors and reviews the Group’s response to climate change and reports its findings and recommendations to the Board. The Committee meets three times a year and has a wide cross section of members from across the Group’s disciplines. It receives external expert advice as necessary. A senior Executive Director has recently been appointed to the Committee, who is directly responsible for overseeing and executing the decisions of the Committee at a Group and operational level. This, together with the appointment of a Group Sustainability Manager, will bring increased focus to the risks and opportunities surrounding climate change.</c>

              <c>Governance Mitigating climate change is a key priority for our senior leadership, with sustainable finance metrics included in the Group’s strategic priorities. In 2018, there were two presentations on sustainability to the HSBC Holdings Board, two to the Group Audit Committee, four to the Group Risk Committee, and two to the HSBC Group Management Board. Senior leadership have engaged with regulators, industry associations and non-governmental organisations on this topic, such as through the Bank of England consultation on climate change, the Group Chairman’s participation in the One Planet Summit and the Group Chief Executive’s designation as a World Economic Forum climate leader. A summarised list of HSBC’s sustainability-related memberships is available at: www.hsbc.com/our- approach/measuring-our-impact/ sustainability-memberships.</c>

              <c>ESG is integrated into our investment and asset management activities. Identifying potential sustainability risks and opportunities helps us to understand the actions that may be required to bring the assets in line with our ESG Policy and Investment Principles. Climate change poses potential risks to our long-term ability to operate. For example, revenue could be impacted by potential carbon pricing, which could increase construction and operating costs; or through increased capital expenditure, which could be needed to adapt to more extreme weather patterns, such as flooding or heatwaves, potentially damaging assets and interrupting operations for our customers.</c>

              <c>The role of the Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESCo) (formerly the Corporate and Social Responsibility Committee (CSRC)) is to review and advise the Board on Shell’s strategy, policies and performance in the areas of safety, environment, ethics and reputation against the Shell General Business Principles, the Shell Code of Conduct, and the HSSE &amp; SP Control Framework. During 2019, the Committee reviewed its purpose and updated its terms of reference to ensure it focuses on areas of most strategic importance to Shell. This resulted in a name change effective from December 2019. The SESCo’s duties comprise, for example, to review progress towards meeting Shell’s ambitions regarding climate change, the energy transition and its Net Carbon Footprint. The Committee also has a duty to advise the Remuneration Committee on metrics relating to sustainable development and energy transition. In 2019, the SESCo balanced its time between a number of topics, with discussion in depth including the energy transition and climate change, Shell’s Net Carbon Footprint ambition, and the Company’s environmental and societal licence to operate. The SESCo conducted one major site visit in Singapore, where the agenda included reviewing Shell’s developing New Energies businesses in the country. In 2020, the Committee’s focus will be on safety, Shell’s policies and commitments related to climate change, environmental performance – for example, in Nigeria and our Canada LNG project – and on specific issues such as plastics, methane, and nature-based solutions. We will continue to advise the Remuneration Committee on metrics concerning sustainability and energy transition.</c>

              <c>As providers of debt capital increasingly come under pressure to support only sustainable businesses and comply with the Paris Agreement and other requirements, more capital will be allocated to ESG compliant funding. By incorporating metrics linked to our climate change targets into financing terms, we are able to attract a diverse portfolio of investors and help us achieve a lower cost capital on average. We also have an incentive to meet our targets and avoid a potential 25bps interest on our $800m sustainability-linked bond from 1 January 2025.

              <c>An important part of our strategy on climate change issues is to engage suppliers and build greater awareness, action and resilience to changes in climate across the food and clothing industry. In the food supply chain, we have worked in partnership with tea, coffee and produce suppliers to ensure that they are building capacity in their producer and grower networks on climate change resilience. This has included projects focused on improving water management for coffee growers in Peru and increasing resilience of British growers through our Farming with Nature programme, with an emphasis on enhancing biodiversity and pollinator protection programmes. To meet changing customer demands for more vegan offerings due to climate considerations, M&amp;S also launched a significant category of vegan food in 2019 (Plant Kitchen). Furthermore in 2020, a new Food Innovation Hub was established to spearhead sustainability solutions, including soya-alternative proteins</c>

              <c>Sustainability and Climate Change was increased to a high risk. Cyber Security and Data Protection risk has also increased in severity during the year due to the general threat of criminal activity in this area. In addition, the Acquisition of New Businesses risk has been increased in severity in the context of the Group potentially considering larger acquisitions or targets in new territories. IT systems implementation risk has moved down the register in light of ongoing governance over business unit projects, as has the Competition risks with the investment and progress businesses have made with their online sales platforms during the year.</c>

              <c>The risks identified in the risk register include customer, market cyclicality, and climate change risk. On top of this, the risk of Covid-19 quickly elevated from being an emerging risk to something that impacted all the principal risks facing our business. At a headline level, the categories of principal risk pre-Covid-19 were broadly the same as last year, but that does not mean that things remained static. Matters such as data security and data governance had broadened in scope, as had the considerations relating to health and safety, and the well-being of our employees. At the same time, the Committee recognised the fact that the Brexit risk remains and there are longer-term sustainability risks, including climate change, for us to address. However, the pervasive nature of the Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally affected all aspects of our business and our response is set out on pages 2 and 3.</c>

              <c>BlackRock’s approach to sustainable investing In January 2020, Larry Fink wrote a letter to CEOs saying that climate change will fundamentally reshape modern finance. In addition, BlackRock announced it would make sustainability its new standard for investing, by doubling down on product innovation while also achieving full ESG integration across our active platform. Our sustainability strategy is focused on long-term value creation. As a fiduciary asset manager we believe that our clients should consider how climate change, policy and economic shifts will affect returns in their portfolios. We believe that climate risk is investment risk. Further, BlackRock believes that the net zero transition will reshape the real economy and financial portfolios, presenting risks and opportunities for investors.</c>

These extreme weather events have resulted in an increase in political focus, regulation and focus on the economic and social impact of climate change. At the same time, customers have become more attentive to the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of their saving and investment decisions.</c>

              <c>Society Sustainability, including climate change, is becoming an ever more pressing challenge facing society. Many would argue that the pursuit of sustainable goals can be constrained by a lack of accompanying social progress, including efforts to address social and economic inequality. Business has an important role to play in addressing each of these challenges – but the private sector cannot address the unprecedented challenge of climate change alone. It needs to work within strong and predictable policy frameworks and alongside robust local and global institutions promoting inclusive and sustainable growth.</c>

              <c>The risk management process for climate-related risks is incorporated within broader risk management arrangements for the Group. The Board takes overall responsibility for risk management, and the assessment of risk. Our approach combines a top-down strategic review and feedback of risks by the Board, coupled with a bottom- up review and reporting of risk by each operating business. Sustainability has been recognised as a risk to the Group for over a decade and more recently climate change has been identified as a separate risk which must be managed.</c>

              <c>The standard methodology used in risk management requires each identified risk to be assessed and measured according to a risk matrix. This matrix considers the potential impact of each risk, (whether financial, reputational, HSE etc), the likelihood of the event occurring, together with mitigating actions and hence the remaining or residual risk. Our risk registers are refreshed on an ongoing basis as part of our financial planning cycle. The registers feed into a formal risk assessment that identifies the Principal Risks and Uncertainties (see pages 44 to 47) and other key risks which are monitored closely, and allows the Board to re-evaluate the identified strategic risks facing the Group. Our Sustainability and Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Register highlights the material risks and opportunities facing the Company in relation to sustainability and climate change and forms part of our Corporate Risk Management Framework. More information is provided in our Sustainability Report 2016.</c>

Entire supply chains are coming under pressure not just to conform to local requirements but also to higher international standards as well – be these environmental, labour or sourcing. Increasingly shareholders seek to protect the long term viability of their businesses and investments and ESG standards are being used by current and potential investors as a critical part of their assessment criteria. These challenges present both a need for driving change at scale but also an opportunity for long term value creation. This goes to the heart of Coats’ values and standards. Our sustainability programme is integrated with our business strategy and helps us build and maintain both our reputation and our relationships with key stakeholders. Specifically in relation to climate change we treat this as an emerging risk which means that it is considered at Board level and we will be developing our mitigation approaches during 2020.

              <c>The EU Regulation on Sustainability-Related Disclosures introduces disclosure obligations requiring financial institutions to explain how they integrate environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions for certain financial products. In addition, the EU Taxonomy Regulation provides for a general framework for the development of an EU-wide classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities. In the UK, the FCA has announced that the UK Green Taxonomy Technical Screening Criteria will be finalised by the end of 2022. Reporting against the Taxonomy will form part of the UK’s new Sustainability Disclosure Requirements (SDR). Certain companies will be required to disclose which portion of their activities are Taxonomy-aligned. The structure of the Taxonomy draws on the EU approach and has six environmental objectives (climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity). The UK regulators are also consulting on a new SDR Framework for firms as well as investment product disclosures, including a new sustainable investment labelling regime.</c>

              <c>We have made significant steps forward in the area of ESG this year. We have built a new sustainability function which delivered our first sustainability report for the Group, allowing us to showcase all of our ESG work. We are also seeing the emergence of ESG as a recruitment market, and by being at the forefront of this industry, we are helping the best candidates get the best roles. This in turn helps our clients and allows them to combat climate change.</c>

              <c>Climate change has the potential to impact our strategy through increased operational and raw material costs and reduced demand for goods, as well as commercial opportunities associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy. Identification and management of sustainability risks is incorporated in our strategic risk assessment processes. Our Group Sustainability Committee (GSC), a sub-committee of the Group Executive, monitors short-term (1-3 years), and medium and long-term (over 3 years) sustainability risks, alongside their probability, potential impact on our business, and our mitigation measures. The GSC meets at least twice a year and risks are reviewed at each meeting. Our most significant risks are included in our sustainability risk register (part of our overall Group risk management process). At an asset level, we manage climate-related risks through our insurance programmes and by incorporating climate change factors into our planning and design of new stores, refurbishment projects and preventative maintenance programmes.</c>

Climate change was identified as an emerging risk in 2019 and elevated to a principal risk in 2020. The pervasive and complex nature of climate change means that it can act as an amplifier of other risks such as environmental incidents, access to water, health and safety of our people, government regulations, and social licence to operate. The Head of Sustainability supports the process to refine the identification and risk assessment of physical and transitional risks.</c>

This year we were ranked as the top performing company in the NextGeneration benchmark of the 25 largest housebuilders, after having maintained second place for the previous seven years. We have also maintained our position in the FTSE4Good Index and significantly improved our score in the Carbon Disclosure Project – in recognition of our high levels of transparency and action on climate change far in advance of the industry average.</c>

              <c>Climate change and sustainability Scarcity of resources and the impact of climate change are a growing economic concern which will drive a change in consumer and regulator behaviour. Demand for energy is forecast to increase by as much as 50% by 2030 and water withdrawals by 40%. Increasing levels of environmental regulation are expected with the opportunity for rapid innovation in more efficient, lower carbon and higher performance applications delivered with a reduced impact.</c>

              <c>Climate change-related risks are fully integrated with Energean’s multi-disciplinary, company-wide risk management process, per the recommendations of the TCFD. Through the framework, Energean adheres to the latest sustainability and sector-related standards and guidelines (such as TCFD, SASB, and IPIECA ) and is able to identify multi-disciplinary risks and opportunities, including climate change- related risks that could affect the Company, its strategy and operations. The risk management framework ensures effective identification, assessment, control and monitoring of risks to the Company’s business, in addition to capitalising on potential opportunities. Climate change-related risks are assessed against their potential financial, legal, physical, market and reputational impact, and key strategic and commercial decisions are assessed on their financial importance.</c>

              <c>Climate change There has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact companies. The Group has determined that for them the transition costs to a low carbon economy will be outweighed by business opportunities in terms of new revenue streams linked to sustainability initiatives. This is explained on pages 65 to 68 in the Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 34 to 38 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the “Other information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.</c>

The group has publicly set out its 2030 net carbon zero from operations (excluding product testing and development) and net zero 2050 commitments and has a strategy aligned to meeting these albeit the pathway to the 2050 net zero target is not fully developed.</c>

              <c>Introduction During the year the Board undertook a thorough review of its risk exposure and appetite. On behalf of the Board, the Audit and Risk Committee, alongside the Investment Manager, reassessed the emerging, key and principal risks. This review took account of the increasing importance of risks posed to the Company and its portfolio from accelerating climate change and wider sustainability matters. More recently, the conversations between the Board and the Investment Manger have been dominated by the current and potential impact of Covid-19 on the portfolio.</c>

              <c>During 2019 our risk management team worked through a number of long term scenarios around the potential impact of climate change on Beazley. We have also continued to look at ways of acting more responsibly within our business, such as sourcing our office products locally. During 2019 our submission to Climatewise was benchmarked against the framework from the Financial Stability Board’s Taskforce on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) achieving a preliminary score of 39% (compared to the average score within the Lloyd’s Market of 38%). It is clear from this score that we are at the same stage of our development on climate change as many others, but we know that more needs to be done. As such we are currently recruiting a sustainability officer who will oversee our strategy on climate change going forward while building on the progress made so far.</c>

              <c>The Group recognises the importance of climate change, both as a global crisis and as a business risk. In addition to mitigating our impact on climate, we also consider the risks that climate change has on our business. The Group’s sustainability strategy has been developed with an aspiration to have the capability and capacity to respond positively to complex issues, such as climate change. Acknowledging this, the Group has established targets to transition towards a net zero future in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and the continued progress made at COP26 with the finalisation of the Glasgow Climate Pact. Although the requirement to report on TCFD is not applicable to the Group until FY22, we have set out below a roadmap outlining our efforts under the four pillars of the TCFD as well as our progress to date.</c>

              <c>The progress made in 2016 is reflected in our community fund, which continues to develop and support numerous projects and initiatives across our Fitzrovia and Tech Belt portfolios. During 2016, the fund supported 20 organisations (seven in Fitzrovia and 13 in the Tech Belt) with over £110,000 invested across a diverse range of grass-roots community projects. Following feedback from our stakeholders, we introduced our first supply chain standard, which is designed to clearly set out our expectations of suppliers across a series of sustainability and governance issues. These issues range from employment/labour standards to payment practices and health and safety. The standard was distributed to all the major suppliers in our property management and development supply chains and they were formally required to acknowledge and adhere to it. Moreover, it has been included as a standard feature in our contractual agreements with suppliers. Going forward we will be monitoring compliance against the standard to ensure it is being implemented robustly. A copy of the standard can be found at www.derwentlondon.com/sustainability/approach. 2016 also saw a significant step forward in international climate change legislation, with 195 countries, including the UK, signing the legally binding Paris Agreement on climate change. The agreement aims to keep global temperature increases well below 20C and cut carbon emissions to virtually zero by 2050. In signing this agreement, the UK Government sent a clear signal not only of its commitment to carbon reduction, but also to businesses that they must reduce their carbon footprints and ensure they are resilient to the effects of climate change.</c>

These considerations did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgements and estimates, consistent with the assessment that climate change is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group’s going concern assessment to June 2023 nor the viability of the Group over the next five years. The following specific points were considered:</c>

We aim to effect meaningful change and improvement within our businesses during our ownership period. By setting a strong focus on sustainability improvement within each business we acquire, we want our businesses to continue their trajectory even after our ownership period.</c>

              <c>Daniel Kitchen, Chairman of the Board, held focus groups with employees in his role as the designated Non-Executive Director for employee engagement. Key issues raised during the year included ideas to enhance our customer offer as well as thoughtful discussions around health and well-being for both customers and employees, sustainability and climate change. We have incorporated these ideas into our Board discussions and explored with the Executive team how to implement these ideas further. One of the first significant actions taken was the expansion of the Executive Committee.</c>

              <c>Description and impact The increased frequency of extreme weather and climate-related natural disasters can lead to physical damage to our sites in addition to disruptions in our businesses’ supply chains. Additionally, new legislation, regulations and corporate governance practices in relation to the environment may require additional expense, restrict commercial flexibility and business strategies, or introduce additional liabilities for the Group or the Directors.

We are already taking active steps to anticipate how climate change will affect our businesses, as described in the Sustainability report, and to encourage firm progress from our businesses in respect of positive climate action. We will continue to strengthen our understanding of the specific climate-related risks that our businesses face as we work to mitigate these risks. We are also encouraging our businesses to identify the reporting metrics that are the most important for their businesses and which they believe will add value.</c>

              <c>Climate change risk management as a business The identification, assessment and management of climate-related risks, along with other ESG-related risks, is integrated into the M&amp;G plc ESG Risk Management Framework. As climate change is one of our sustainability thematic priorities it is a key area of oversight for second line Risk and Compliance teams. Consideration and prioritisation of climate risk is also built into the decision-making and governance processes and is a requirement of key strategic Board risk assessment papers.</c>

              <c>REORGANISATION IN LINE WITH UPDATED STRATEGY During 2020, we worked on a comprehensive organisational review in order to enable our new strategy to be effective. We call this project Reshape. The governance of topics around sustainability, including climate change, will not change at the most senior levels of Shell. We are introducing changes at specific levels of the organisation to better address the effects of the strategy update. We expect to adjust the initial structure as we go through the process. Currently, we are working towards going live with the revised organisational structure in the second half of 2021.</c>

              <c>In each scenario, climate change could present a risk to Bunzl’s future financial performance (when assessed against Bunzl’s projected future profits). However, our assessment suggests that in no scenario do the climate-related risks assessed present a significant financial risk to the business (as defined by our risk management processes) and therefore we currently believe our business to be fundamentally resilient to the potential impacts of climate change. Moreover, the transition to a net zero economy will present good opportunities to the Group, specifically through the provision of environmentally friendly products and sustainability expertise to customers.</c>

              <c>Alongside this, the committee also considered sustainability risks and opportunities facing the Group, focusing in detail on those relating to climate change. This is an area that affects all of our key stakeholders and the way we do business and so it is a priority for us to ensure we understand the impact climate change can have. A cross-functional team has been set up to evaluate these risks and opportunities in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure. In 2020 the team focused on three areas – plantations and wood procurement, products and operations. The work resulted in the identification of a number of specific risks and opportunities and quantification of the potential financial impact in each case. This provides context for the committee during its future discussions around climate change and allows it to focus on the issues identified as having the greatest impact. It is also clear that this is an evolutionary process and our understanding of the impact these risks and opportunities might have will develop over time. More details can be found on page 80.</c>

These approaches address many of the recommendations of TCFD. In addition, during 2021, we have worked with third-party experts to undertake a review of the Group’s climate change risks and opportunities, across various scenarios and time horizons, to ensure divisional and Group management teams have a thorough understanding of their most relevant climate change-related risks and opportunities, and to inform our response to TCFD recommendations.

              <c>Society Sustainability, including climate change, is becoming an ever more pressing challenge facing society. Many would argue that the pursuit of sustainable goals can be constrained by a lack of accompanying social progress, including efforts to address social and economic inequality. Business has an important role to play in addressing each of these challenges – but the private sector cannot address the unprecedented challenge of climate change alone. It needs to work within strong and predictable policy frameworks and alongside robust local and global institutions promoting inclusive and sustainable growth.</c>

Climate change is a global challenge and an emerging risk to businesses, people and the environment across the world. We have a role to play in limiting warming by improving our energy management, reducing our carbon emissions and by helping our customers do the same. Growing awareness of climate change and customer sustainability targets will provide impetus for business growth as we provide products, services and solutions that increase efficiency and reduce customers’ energy use and carbon emissions. As an online business, 888’s activities have a relatively small impact on the environment when compared to a great number of companies that operate in more resource intensive industries. However, recognising that climate change poses a risk to our business through global economic disruption and impacts on the welfare of our employees, we seek to integrate environmental considerations into every level of decision-making from the administration of our offices to long-term business strategy. In our view climate change doesn’t represent a material estimation uncertainty. For further detail see the corporate social responsibility section of the Strategic Report.</c>

              <c>The standard methodology used in risk management requires each identified risk to be assessed and measured according to a risk matrix. This matrix considers the potential impact of each risk, (whether financial, reputational, HSE etc), the likelihood of the event occurring, together with mitigating actions and hence the remaining or residual risk. Our risk registers are refreshed on an ongoing basis as part of our financial planning cycle. The registers feed into a formal risk assessment that identifies the Principal Risks and Uncertainties (see pages 38 to 41) and other key risks which are monitored closely, and allows both the Audit Committee and the Board to re-evaluate the identified risks facing the Group. Our Sustainability and Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Register highlights the material risks and opportunities facing the Company in relation to sustainability and climate change and forms part of our Corporate Risk Management Framework.

              <c>In planning and executing our audit, we considered the Group’s climate change risk assessment process and this, together with involvement of our own sustainability specialists, provided us with an understanding of the potential impact of climate change on the financial statements. We assessed that the key financial statement line items and estimates which are more likely to be materially impacted by climate risks are those associated with future cash flows, given the more notable impacts of climate change on the business are expected to arise in the medium to long term. These include the impairment assessment of goodwill, the carrying value of ships and the carrying value of the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, as well as specific consideration of the impact of climate change on likely ship ownership periods, residual value estimates for ships, and the related impact on annual depreciation charges. Our key audit matters further explain how we evaluated the impact of climate change.</c>

              <c>During the prior year, and for the first time, Sustainability was reported separately as a GER. This reflected the growing focus on the potential risks and opportunities of climate change and other environmental considerations on HomeServe’s business model. In FY21, there has been further attention given to this issue, part of which is detailed on page 30 of the Responsible business section. Environmental considerations are integral to the risk frameworks managed by each of the Group’s businesses, and the focus of the Board on these matters was formalised during the year in the adoption of a Group Environment Policy. The Group notes that the requirements of the Taskforce on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) will apply from FY22 and intends to use its disclosures under this framework to report its progress. As such, Sustainability is no longer reported separately as a GER.</c>

              <c>69</c>
              <c>To support this commitment and ensure we minimise our risk exposure to the effects of climate change, we have developed a comprehensive management strategy underpinned by a clear and challenging science based emissions target. Further details of this strategy and target can be found in our Annual Sustainability Report at www.derwentlondon.com/ sustainability. Yet again, our work has been recognised externally with the receipt, for a fifth consecutive year, of a five star rating (Green Star) in the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB). We also received a new and improved rating in the CDP index, achieving a ‘Management B’ rating. In addition, and for the fourth successive year, our Annual Sustainability Report received a Gold Award in the EPRA Reporting Awards. Finally, we were ranked 12th in Corporate Knights 2017 Global 100 companies, and were the highest placed UK based company – the list announced at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos each year rates the world’s best companies on their sustainability performance as well as their management of resources, finances and employees. In 2015, we introduced more demanding and longer-term targets designed to challenge us, whilst ensuring we deliver against our strategic sustainability objectives. This continued into 2016, when we set more targets in this way to help us improve our performance. Moreover, we updated and strengthened our internal key performance indicators to ensure we maintain our high standards. Similar to last year, we have set out a breakdown of our performance – both in terms of our external facing targets and internal key performance indicators – to give a complete picture of our performance. We hope the summary presented here gives you a sense of our progress and achievements during 2016.

Climate risk is now clearly defined within our enterprise risk universe as a Principal Strategic Risk. It was discussed at several of the 15 Board of Director (“Board”) meetings held in 2021 and was a central focus of the six meetings of the Sustainability &amp; Safety Committee. At the same time, we also see climate change, and the associated energy transition, as a significant strategic opportunity, underpinned by a robust demand for natural gas.</c>

However, it must be recognised that all businesses need to consider the effects of their business on climate change, and also on the planet. Our overall priority within sustainability is to minimise the environmental footprint of our operations, products and services around the world. Whilst our efforts are mainly based around the more efficient use of energy, various other initiatives to reduce our carbon footprint have been developed during the last year. We are also preparing plans to meet net zero carbon by 2050.</c>

              <c>Exhibitions Reed Exhibitions’ events help strengthen communities and support our corporate responsibility focus areas. New York Comic Con, which attracted 167,000 attendees in 2015, supports the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, a non-profit organisation protecting the rights of comics artists, publishers, retailers, librarians and fans. The show featured sessions on fighting censorship. Each year, World Travel Market, Reed Exhibitions’ flagship show for the travel and tourism industry, holds World Responsible Tourism Day. In 2015, the focus was on climate change in the lead-up to the UN COP21 climate talks in Paris. In addition to expert speakers, including Professor of Energy and Climate Change at the University of Manchester, Kevin Anderson, the day featured a senior industry debate on the travel industry’s role in limiting carbon emissions. Reed Exhibitions helped launch the new Promotional Product Service Institute (PSI) Sustainability Awards during the year to evaluate PSI members’ in-house initiatives, products and campaigns for their positive economic, environmental and social impacts.</c>

              <c>Specific risk areas other than the Principal Risks The Group considers other specific risk areas recognising the increasing complexity of the industry in which it operates and are in addition to its identified Principal Risks. These include risks from a wider technology, cyber and climate perspective. We also give consideration to widespread emerging health risks and monitor accordingly. At the time of writing we do not consider coronavirus to pose an immediate risk to our business, but we will continue to monitor closely with our supplier base. We continue to improve and invest in our information technology to mitigate ever-increasing cyber threats and data loss, theft or corruption. Our Sustainability and Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Register highlights the material risks and opportunities facing the Group in relation to sustainability and climate change as well as those monitored on the Group Risk Register. In addition, our climate change related risks and opportunities are available as part of our 2019 CDP submission. More information is available at www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/corporate</c>

              <c>Strategy Acknowledging the growing scientific consensus that the window to tackle climate change is rapidly diminishing, climate change has been discussed at the Admiral Group Board, and at the Sustainability Working Group to ensure consideration in broader ESG topics. Climate change is currently primarily integrated into strategic decisions covering the Group’s investment portfolio management as guided by the Responsible Investment Policy. This year the Group also increased engagement with climate change-focused forums as it signed up to the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and will aim to align ambitions with those of IIGCC.</c>

              <c>Climate change During 2021 we performed a significant amount of risk and opportunity analysis in preparation for our disclosures in line with TCFD. This began with including climate change as a specific agenda item in every functional risk workshop held in the business, and then by working with an independent third party to run a series of dedicated risk workshops with senior leaders in the business. The output of this work is described in more detail in the TCFD section of this report on pages 59 to 76. Following the identification and qualification of the risks and opportunities in 2021, the next step is to quantify the risks and opportunities. Our strategic planning will consider how best to take advantage of the opportunities, particularly in supporting our customers to reduce their emissions, as well as look internally to minimise our own impact on climate change. The Group has embedded the identification of climate-related risks and opportunities into the Group’s risk management framework. Risks are identified throughout the normal course of business and captured in detailed risk registers. This includes assessment of the physical risks of climate change and the risks related to the transition to a low carbon economy. The ESG Committee has monitored the development of our ESG Strategy, including the risks associated with climate change, and during the year we published our first Sustainability Report which highlighted risks and opportunities associated with climate change.</c>

Once identified, we will work towards obtaining a better understanding of the potential financial impacts using our established scoring criteria, and our resilience with regards to different scenarios.</c>

              <c>STRATEGY &amp; RISK MANAGEMENT Climate change is one of the sustainability issues identified in our non-financial materiality assessments. In addition, climate change is also a key driver of water stress which is one of the emerging risks identified by our Enterprise Risk Management activities, as part of Provision 28 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance. We use Aqueduct, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI), to model climate change impacts on water resources. The water risk of our operations and projects is evaluated using climate change scenarios for 2020 and 2030. Further details are presented in the Water Stewardship section of this report.</c>

In 2020, the Board’s Safety, Environment and Sustainability Committee (SESC), formerly the Safety, Health, Environment, Security and Ethics Committee, met to review performance against climate targets as well as the opportunity to strengthen our net zero commitments, which were later approved by the Board. To continuously improve governance in this area, Board members will receive climate change training during 2021.</c>

              <c>There has been an increase in regulatory focus on the issue of sustainable finance, particularly the impacts that climate change risks could have on the safety and soundness of firms and stability of the financial system. The PRA Supervisory Statement SS3/19 set out regulatory expectations about the management of the financial risks linked to climate change. The related PRA Policy Statement PS11/19 requires firms to set out plans for identifying and managing financial risks from climate change. Climate change could affect Just Group’s financial risks in two key ways: (i) as investors increasingly consider sustainability in their investment choices this may restrict investment choice and compress yields in the existing investment universe; it may also create new opportunities to invest in assets that are perceived to be more sustainable; and (ii) increased physical risks such as flooding due to severe rainfall or tidal surges, wildfires, extreme windstorms or heatwaves leading to increased subsidence may affect the value of properties not seen as having such an exposure at present. This could affect our ability to recover the full balances of lifetime mortgages in light of the no-negative equity guarantee.</c>

              <c>Asset risk: This is the risk that climate change has a significant impact across a number of industries which may negatively impact the value of investments in those companies. The Group considers the impact of climate change on its asset portfolio by seeking to incorporate an assessment of environmental risks in the investment process. We subscribe to the research services of a specialist company in the field of environmental, social and governance research and have integrated their proprietary ratings into the internal credit process applied to investments in corporate debt securities. A minimum standard for environmental, social and governance performance is defined and companies not meeting the required standard will be excluded from the approved list of issuers. The analysis also includes consideration of the sustainability of each company with regard to the potential decline in demand in specific sectors.</c>

              <c>Taken together, this dynamic promises to only increase pressures on businesses and the financial sector to step up their sustainability credentials.

Despite the profound immediate social and economic disruption caused by COVID-19, the pandemic is likely to prove a longer-term spur to address the range of sustainability challenges that we face. Rather than undermining climate action, it has helped to catalyse a concerted global effort to address climate change and drive towards net-zero economies, which bodes well for long-term growth prospects.</c>

              <c>Sustainability We are acutely aware of the increasing concerns our people, customers, suppliers, governments, and shareholders have around climate change and sustainability issues in general. We have taken a lead in our industry in developing and promoting high-efficiency products that consume less energy and therefore help reduce carbon emissions over their lifetime in use. We established a Sustainability Committee as early as 2009 and set ourselves the bold goal of becoming the leader in our industry regarding sustainability matters. We have consistently incorporated sustainability factors into our decision making and have adopted environmentally</c>

              <c>Climate change and biodiversity are included as key risks in our consolidated Group Risk Register. Sustainability risks are also integrated into our corporate risk management framework, through function risk registers and our Climate Change and Sustainability Risk and Opportunity Register. Our Climate Change Register guides the climate change adaptation of our business practices and the homes we build. For each climate-related risk and opportunity the register identifies: risk driver, description of risk, potential impact, timeframe, whether the risk or opportunity is direct or indirect, likelihood and magnitude of impact. This is a standing item on every LEAF committee agenda. The committee makes recommendations to the GMT on how to mitigate, transfer, accept, or control climate-related risks. We prioritise our climate change risks and opportunities based on their materiality to our business, measured in % of profit before tax (PBT). A % PBT greater than 20% is considered a major impact. A large risk in terms of likelihood is a greater than 50% chance.</c>

              <c>In planning and executing our audit we have considered the Group’s risk assessment process following their work with the Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies (described in the Sustainability Report above). This, together with discussions with our own sustainability specialists, provided us with a good understanding of the potential impact of climate change on the financial statements. We assessed that the key financial statement line items and estimates which are more likely to be materially impacted by climate risks are those associated with future cash flows, given the more notable impacts of climate change on the business are expected to arise in the medium to long term. These include the impairment assessment of goodwill and landing rights, the assessment of impairment of investments held by easyJet plc as a standalone Company and the recoverability of the Group’s deferred tax assets; our key audit matters further explain how we have evaluated the impact of climate change. We have also specifically considered the impact of climate change on likely aircraft ownership periods, residual value changes for less fuel-efficient aircraft, and the related impact on ongoing depreciation charges.</c>

Automotive OEMs in every major market have announced ambitious plans to address climate change through the electrification of the vehicle fleet and significant decarbonisation of their own manufacturing operations and supply bases. In addition to public announcements and press coverage, the Group’s commercial and engineering teams are in regular contact with our OEM customers and, over the last several years, we have seen firsthand the growing investment, activity and definition around both powertrain electrification and supplier sustainability in the form of advanced development activities and quoting packages for BEV and HEV programmes as well as business awards that include supplier commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Likewise, investors, regulators, and consumers have clearly communicated the expectation that all businesses must take demonstrable actions to improve environmental sustainability as well as climate-related analysis and disclosures.</c>

The group considers the impact of climate change on its asset portfolio by seeking to incorporate an assessment of environmental risks in the investment process. We subscribe to the research services of a specialist company in the field of environmental, social and governance research and have integrated their proprietary ratings into the internal credit process applied to investments in corporate debt securities. A minimum standard for environmental, social and governance performance is defined and companies not meeting the required standard will be excluded from the approved list of issuers. The analysis also includes consideration of the sustainability of each company with regard to the potential decline in demand in specific sectors.</c>

              <c>Sustainability Managing sustainability is core to how we do business. We have a CSR Committee that is run through the Management and covers all aspects of sustainability. This year the Committee has overseen the creation of a new ESG policy, which sets out the Group’s approach to managing sustainability from acquisition, development and asset management. We regularly monitor the regulatory landscape to ensure we adhere to all relevant ESG-related legislation and our membership of the UK Green Building Council – a global network dedicated to a sustainable built environment – means we can access best practice advice and guidance to ensure we future-proof our assets against the risks of climate change and other environmental impacts. The Group has recruited a Sustainability Lead to develop a long-term sustainability strategy and improve the sustainability performance of the Group.</c>

The role and responsibilities of the Board and each of its Committees in relation to sustainability is set out within our dedicated Sustainability Governance Framework on page 59. The Board is also focused on the leading role the Company must play in addressing the impact of climate change and the contribution we can make as a business to mitigate our own impact and that of our supply chain, and adapt to the challenges that climate change may bring in the future. Further detail on our climate change action plan can be found within our dedicated Sustainability Report.</c>

              <c>Social and environmental issues have become fundamental factors to consider for any organisation or business. Stakeholder expectations demand that they are considered and increasingly legislation and regulation seek to address some of the more pressing issues, such as climate change, human rights and corruption. Sustainability as a concept is now mainstream for many organisations, with notable leadership from the United Nations with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</c>

              <c>We continue to make good progress on our sustainability actions which form part of our sustainability strategy. The sustainability strategy provides a formal framework for the Company to monitor and track sustainability targets. The Manager’s CSR Committee regularly reports up to the Board with recommendations and progress reports on its ESG initiatives. Eva-Lotta Sjöstedt is our “ESG Champion” on the Board and engages directly with the Manager’s Sustainability Lead on various sustainability topics. A focus for the period has been understanding the risks and opportunities presented by climate change and the impacts it could have on our business operations.

              <c>As members of the Prince of Wales Accounting for Sustainability (A4S) initiative, we are working towards implementing the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures. In line with their recommendations and to future-proof our business, climate change is included as a principal risk in our Risk and Viability Report. During FY 2018/19, we conducted three scenario-planning workshops, involving senior leadership from key functions across the business, including Risk, Strategy, Investor Relations, Customer Insight, Responsibility, Supply Chain, IT and External Communications. Facilitated by Forum for the Future, the workshops helped us identify and assess long-term environmental, social and technological trends that could significantly impact Burberry’s business model and operations over the next 20 years. These trends will inform our long-term supply chain strategy and our strategic response to climate change risks, a process that has already started with the presentation of key insights to the Board in March 2019.</c>

              <c>One of the joys of investing in a company’s equity, rather than debt, is that you are investing in an adaptable, living entity, made up of people, who can pre-empt challenges, and adjust – often long before financial markets have started to discount an issue. Engaging with boards and management on sustainability and governance questions, such as the climate change investigations we have recently been making, is one way of testing which companies are truly adaptable, and thinking imaginatively about the opportunities and challenges they may face. There are of course other risks and challenges beyond climate change, ranging from the new coronavirus to continued uncertainty relating to the UK’s future trading relationship with Europe. In this environment it is possible the level of sterling may also see further changes, which would have an impact on both the sterling value of SAINTS’ overseas assets and of its overseas income. As fund managers, we are always mindful of such risks in relation to both stock selection and the overall balance of the portfolio.</c>

              <c>Our risk profile has not fundamentally changed this year but we have now more clearly highlighted that Climate Change is one of our principal risk factors. For a number of years we have recognised that changes in climate pose a risk to our business and hence as a part of our Unilever Sustainable Living Plan we are trying to both reduce our impact on climate change and to prepare ourselves for the impact climate change will have on our business in the coming years, and this risk and our management approach were outlined within our Sustainability risk factor. However following discussions at the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, 21st Conference and the Financial Services Board Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, it is clear that the impacts of climate change itself and the potential actions government may take are of such significance that Climate Risk should be separately identified.</c>

We hit the ground running by signing the UN Global Compact and publishing our inaugural sustainability report. As an organisation we set out a bold ten-year sustainability vision, including ambitious targets. We recognise the global workforce must adapt to combat global climate change, and to assist with this transition we have enhanced our offering to include recruitment and placement of sustainability professionals. This represents a new business opportunity for us, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this industry as it becomes established.</c>

              <c>Consequently, we refreshed our Sustainability Agenda (as an integral part of our evolved Group Strategy) to reflect the prominence of tobacco harm reduction and also to place a greater emphasis on the importance of addressing climate change and environmental management. At the same time, we remain committed to delivering a positive social impact and ensuring robust corporate governance across the Group.</c>

              <c>The Group will also experience transitional risks associated to low carbon economy. The TCFD was introduced by the Financial Sustainability Board (FSB) for companies, investors and other financial stakeholders to disclose climate-related financial risk. As climate change legislation is evolving rapidly, companies are required to adapt quickly to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate climate change related transitional risks, failure to adapt could lead to BAT scoring lower in sustainability benchmarking indices, such as CDP and DJSI.</c>

              <c>Governance and assurance The Sustainability Committee oversees strategies to manage social and environmental risks, including management processes and standards. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of management policies and procedures relating to safety, health, employment practices (apart from remuneration, which is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee), relationships with neighbouring communities, environment, security and human rights, land access, political involvement and sustainable development. Given its strategic significance, climate change is overseen directly by the Board. See the Governance section (pages 156-158) for more information about the Sustainability Committee.</c>

              <c>In recognition of the importance of climate change in global political and economic agendas, as well as our increased understanding of climate impacts on the Group’s operations, the Executive Committee has identified climate change as an emerging risk. The risk will be considered as part of our existing risk management process. This consideration will also support alignment with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’) recommendations. Further detail on the Group’s sustainability strategy and the 2021 work plan to develop our alignment with TCFD is set out on pages 50 to 59.</c>

              <c>In 2021 we invested over £153 million across our businesses on climate-related research and development, for example, to develop products that help their customers to improve their energy efficiency and to reduce their GHG emissions compared with conventional technologies. Please see the Technology case studies contained within the Divisional reviews on pages 12 to 29 and on page 59 of this Sustainability report for further examples. We have described how sustainability and climate-related issues are integrated into our broader strategy in the description of our strategy and business model on pages 2 and 3. Climate change has a direct impact on product strategy, development, and financial planning across all of our businesses. Our businesses work closely with their customers, partners, and world-class research institutions to develop market- leading, cost-effective innovations and deliver solutions that address environmental challenges. In the Sustainability report on pages 58 and 59, we have provided details on how we are embedding low carbon transition into our businesses alongside our relevant targets.</c>
